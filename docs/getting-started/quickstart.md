This guide describes how to quickly get started with NetBird and create a secure private network with 2 connected machines.

One machine is a Linux laptop, and the other one a EC2 node running on AWS.
Both machines are running Linux but NetBird also works on Windows and MacOS.

1. Sign-up at [https://app.netbird.io/](https://app.netbird.io/)

   You can use your Google, GitHub or Microsoft account.

2. After a successful login you will be redirected to the ```Peers``` screen which is empty because you don't have any peers yet.

   Click ```Add peer``` to add a new machine.

3. Choose your machine operating system (in our case it is ```Linux```) and proceed with the installation steps.

4. If you installed NetBird Desktop UI you can use it to connect to the network instead of running `netbird up` command. Look for `NetBird` in your application list, run it, and click `Connect`.

5. At this point a browser window pops up starting a device registration process. Click confirm and follow the steps if required.

6. On the EC2 node repeat the installation steps and run `netbird up` command.  

   ```bash
   sudo netbird up
   ```
7. Copy the verification URL from the terminal output and paste it in your browser. Repeat step #5

8. Return to ```Peers``` and you should notice 2 new machines with status ```online```

9. To test the connection you could try pinging devices:

   On your laptop:
   ```bash
   ping 100.64.0.2
   ```

    On the EC2 node:
    ```bash
   ping 100.64.0.1
   ```
10. Done! You now have a secure peer-to-peer private network configured.
