This guide is a part of the [NetBird Self-hosting Guide](/getting-started/self-hosting) and explains how to integrate 
**self-hosted** NetBird with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/).

Keycloak is an open source software product to allow single sign-on with Identity and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services.

:::tip managed idp
If you prefer not to self-host an Identity and Access Management solution, then you could use a managed alternative like
[Auth0](/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/using-netbird-with-auth0).
:::

The following guide is an adapted version of the original
[Keycloak on Docker](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker) guide from the official website.

### Expected Result

After completing this guide, you can log in to your self-hosted NetBird Dashboard and add your machines 
to your network using the [Interactive SSO Login feature](/getting-started/installation#running-netbird-with-sso-login) 
over Keycloak.

### Step 1: Check your Keycloak Instance

For this guide, you need a fully configured Keycloak instance running with SSL.

We assume that your Keycloak instance is available at **`https://YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND_PORT`**. 
Feel free to change the port if you have configured Keycloak with a different one.

Most of the OIDC software requires SSL for production use. 
We encourage you to comply with this requirement to make the world more secure ðŸ˜Š.

### Step 2: Create a realm

To create a realm you need to:

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Hover the mouse over the dropdown in the top-left corner where it says `Master`, then click on `Create Realm`
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Realm name: `netbird`
- Click `Create`
-

### Step 3: Create a user

In this step we will create a NetBird administrator user.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Users` (left-hand menu)
- Click `Create new user`
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Username: `netbird`
- Click `Create`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-create-user.png)

The user will need an initial password set to be able to log in. To do this:
- Click `Credentials` tab
- Click `Set password` button
- Fill in the password form with a password
- Set the `Temporary` field to `Off` to prevent having to update password on first login
- Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-set-password.png)

### Step 4: Create a NetBird client

In this step we will create NetBird application client and register with the Keycloak instance.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Click `Create client` button
- Fill in the form with the following values and click Next:
  - Client Type: `OpenID Connect`
  - Client ID: `netbird-client`
- Your newly client `netbird-client` will be used later to set `NETBIRD_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` in the `setup.env`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-create-client.png)

- Check the checkboxes as on the screenshot below and click Save

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-enable-auth.png)

### Step 5: Adjust NetBird client access settings

In this step we will configure NetBird application client access with the NetBird URLs.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Choose `netbird-client` from the list
- Go to `Access Settings` section
- Fill in the fields with the following values:
  - Root URL: `https://YOUR DOMAIN/` (this is the NetBird Dashboard root URL)
  - Valid redirect URIs: `https://YOUR DOMAIN/*`
  - Valid post logout redirect URIs: `https://YOUR DOMAIN/*`
  - Web origins: `+`
  - Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-access-settings.png)

### Step 6: Create a NetBird client scope

In this step, we will create and configure the NetBird client audience for Keycloak to add it to the generated JWT tokens.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Client scopes` (left-hand menu)
- Click `Create client scope` button
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Name: `api`
  - Type: `Default`
  - Protocol: `OpenID Connect`
- Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-create-client-scope.png)

- While in the newly created Client Scope, switch to the `Mappers` tab
- Click `Configure a new mapper`
- Choose the `Audience` mapping

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-configure-audience-mapper.png)

- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Name: `Audience for NetBird Management API`
  - Included Client Audience: `netbird-client`
  - Add to access token: `On`
  - Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-configure-audience-mapper-2.png)

### Step 7: Add client scope to NetBird client

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Choose `netbird-client` from the list
- Switch to `Client scopes` tab
- Click `Add client scope` button
- Choose `api`
- Click `Add` choosing `Default`
- The value `netbird-client` will be used as audience 

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloack-add-client-scope.png)

### Step 8: Create a NetBird-Backend client

In this step we will create NetBird backend client and register with the Keycloak instance.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Click `Create client` button
- Fill in the form with the following values and click Next:
  - Client Type: `OpenID Connect`
  - Client ID: `netbird-backend`
- Your newly client `netbird-backend` will be used later to set `KeycloakClientCredentials` in the `management.json`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-create-backend-client.png)

- Check the checkboxes as on the screenshot below and click Save

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-backend-client-auth.png)

The client will need secret to authenticate. To do this:
- Click `Credentials` tab
- Copy `client secret` will be used later to set `ClientSecret` in the `management.json`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-backend-client-credentials.png)

### Step 9: Add manage-users role to netbird-backend

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Choose `netbird-backend` from the list
- Switch to `Service accounts roles` tab
- Click `Assign roles` button
- Select `Filter by clients` and search for `manage-users`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-service-account-role.png)

- Check the role checkbox and click assign

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-add-role.png)

Your authority OIDC configuration will be available under:
```
https://<YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND-PORT>/realms/netbird/.well-known/openid-configuration
```
:::caution
Double-check if the endpoint returns a JSON response by calling it from your browser.
:::

- Set properties in the `setup.env` file:
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_OIDC_CONFIGURATION_ENDPOINT=`https://<YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND-PORT>/realms/netbird/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=`netbird-client`
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_AUDIENCE=`netbird-client`
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_DEVICE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=`netbird-client`. Optional, 
  it enables the [Interactive SSO Login feature](/getting-started/installation#running-netbird-with-sso-login) (Oauth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow)

- You can now continue with the [NetBird Self-hosting Guide](/getting-started/self-hosting#step-3-configure-identity-provider).

- Set property `IdpManagerConfig` in the `management.json` file with:
  :::caution
  The file management.json is created automatically. Please refer [here](/getting-started/self-hosting#step-5-run-configuration-script) for more information.
  :::

  ```json
  {
    "ManagerType":  "keycloak",
    "KeycloakClientCredentials": {
        "ClientID": "netbird-backend",
        "ClientSecret": "<netbird-backend-client-secret>",
        "GrantType": "client_credentials",
        "TokenEndpoint": "https://<YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND-PORT>/realms/netbird/protocol/openid-connect/token",
        "AdminEndpoint": "https://<YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND-PORT>/admin/realms/netbird"
    }
  }
  ```

:::note
Make sure that your Keycloak instance use HTTPS. Otherwise, the setup won't work.
