## Contributing to the docs

You can click the **Fork** button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. This copy is called a _fork_. Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you are ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request to let us know about it.

Once your pull request is created, a NetBird reviewer will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback. As the owner of the pull request, **it is your responsibility to modify your pull request to address the feedback that has been provided to you by the NetBird reviewer.**

Also, note that you may end up having more than one NetBird reviewer provide you feedback or you may end up getting feedback from a NetBird reviewer that is different than the one initially assigned to provide you feedback.

Furthermore, in some cases, one of your reviewers might ask for a technical review from a NetBird author when needed. Reviewers will do their best to provide feedback in a timely fashion but response time can vary based on circumstances.
