Add environment variables documentation for self-hosted deployments

Adds a comprehensive reference page for all environment variables used
when self-hosting NetBird, covering Management Server, Signal Server,
Relay Server, Dashboard, and Coturn services. Focuses on the new
embedded identity provider approach, removing deprecated external IDP
configuration variables.
