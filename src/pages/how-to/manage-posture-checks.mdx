# Manage access with posture checks

NetBird enables administrators to manage network access by creating access policies that dictate
which peer groups can interact with other peers in your network.
Posture checks extend these policies, augmenting their capabilities by allowing administrators to
enforce access restrictions based on specified criteria. By integrating posture checks seamlessly
into policy-based ACLs, NetBird evaluates various attributes to determine the eligibility of peers to
connect to the network.

## Concepts

### NetBird client version check

The NetBird client version check verifies the version of NetBird installed on the device attempting to connect to the
network. This check ensures that only devices running a specified version of NetBird can gain access,
thus preventing outdated or incompatible clients from compromising network security.

### Operating system version check

The operating system version check evaluates the operating system (OS) version running on the connecting device.
This check allows for enforcing minimum OS requirements, ensuring that only devices with up-to-date and
secure operating systems can access network resources.

<Note>
    This check requires NetBird version [0.26.0](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases) or newer.
</Note>

The check evaluates the actual `OS version` for Android, macOS, and iOS, while for Linux and Windows, it assesses
the `kernel version`.

Below are some examples of OS versions for each operating system:

* Android 14 Upside Down Cake: `14`, `14.3`
* macIS 13	Ventura: `13`, `13.6.4`
* macOS 14 Sonoma: `14`, `14.3.1`
* iOS 16 / iPadOS 16: `16`, `16.7.5`
* Linux kernel: `6`, `6.7.5`
* Windows 10, version 22H2: `10.0.19045`
* Windows 11, version 23H2: `10.0.22631`
* Windows Server 2022, Version 21H2: `10.0.20348`

### Geolocation check

The geolocation check examines the connecting device's geographical location based on its IP address.
This check allows administrators to enforce access restrictions based on geographic regions,
offering country-wide and city-level granularity.

## Managing Posture Checks

Posture Checks are dynamic, and you can create a policy with multiple posture checks. A single posture
check can also be reused across different policies. When managing posture checks, you can update them as
per your requirements.

However, deleting a posture check is only possible if it's not currently used in any policy. If a posture
check is in use, you need to unassigned it from the respective policy before you can delete it.
This precaution ensures the continuity and integrity of your security setup.

Here are some steps to help you create and manage your posture checks effectively:

In the example below, we are creating a posture check that will only allow clients running NetBird version 0.25.0 or
higher to connect and access network resources.

### Creating posture checks
Access the `Access Control` tab, the `Posture Checks` section and click `Create Posture Check`.

<p>

</p>

That will open a posture checks configuration screen where you can configure the checks.

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/posture-check-create-list.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

Select the `NetBird Client Version` check option and set it with the following information:
- Version: `0.25.0`

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/netbird-version-check.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

Click `Save`, and the `NetBird Client Version` check will be enabled.
<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/posture-check-netbird-version-enabled.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

Click `Continue`, fill out the form with the following information, and click `Create Posture Check` to save:
- Name of the posture check: `Netbird Version`
- Description: `Allow Netbird client with version 0.25.0 or greater`

</p>

### Adding posture checks to policy

Navigate to the `Access Control` tab and select the `Policies` section.

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/policies-list.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

Choose the policy to which you want to assign the posture check. This will open the policy update screen. Then,
select the `Posture Checks` tab.
<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/policy-new-posture-check.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

Click `Browse Checks` and select the posture check we created earlier, `Netbird Version`. Then, click `Add Posture Checks`.

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/policy-posture-checks-select.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

The `Netbird Version` check will be assigned to the policy. Click `Save Changes` to save the policy updates.
