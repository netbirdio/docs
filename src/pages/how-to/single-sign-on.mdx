# Authenticate to NetBird with Single Sign On (SSO)

NetBird works out of the box with popular Identity Providers (IdPs) such as Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID, and Okta,
offering seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) for your users.

It also supports social logins including Google, GitHub, and Microsoft accounts.

For other OIDC (OpenID Connect)-compliant IdPs like Authentik, Keycloak, JumpCloud, and others, NetBird provides full support,
though some additional configuration is required to complete the integration.

<Note>
    This guide covers the setup for cloud-hosted NetBird. If you are using the self-hosted version, please refer
    to the [self-hosted documentation](/selfhosted/identity-providers).
</Note>

## Google, Microsoft, and GitHub

If you're using Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID, or a supported social login, you can simply sign in with no extra
setup—just click the appropriate button on the [login page](https://app.netbird.io/):

</p>

## Okta

If you are using Okta as your Identity Provider, sign up with any email address and then follow the steps described
in [this guide](/how-to/okta-sync#get-started-with-net-bird-okta-integration)

## OIDC-compliant IdPs

For OIDC-compliant Identity Providers such as **Authentik**, **Keycloak**, and others, you’ll need to configure the IdP
to integrate with NetBird. Below are the steps to set up different OIDC-compliant IdPs with NetBird.

<Note>
    Support for OIDC-compliant IdPs is available on the Team plan and higher.
    The Free plan supports Google, Microsoft, and social logins.
