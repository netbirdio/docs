# Browser Client - Web-based Remote Access

NetBird's Browser Client enables secure remote access to SSH and RDP resources directly from your web browser, without requiring any client software installation. This feature runs a NetBird peer as WebAssembly (WASM) in your browser, establishing secure connections through your existing NetBird network.

## Overview

The Browser Client provides instant, secure remote access through your browser:
- **No installation required** - Works directly in your browser without any software downloads
- **SSH and RDP support** - Access Linux and Windows machines with complete protocol implementations
- **Secure by design** - All connections are encrypted end-to-end with WireGuard®
- **True peer-to-peer** - Runs a complete NetBird peer as WebAssembly in your browser
- **Works anywhere** - Access your resources from any device with a modern web browser

<Note>
    The Browser Client is a real NetBird peer running entirely in your browser. The management server does not connect to target machines - all connections are made directly from your browser to the target peer through the NetBird network.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before using the Browser Client, ensure:

1. **Admin privileges** - You must be logged into the NetBird dashboard with an admin account (required for temporary ACL creation)
2. **Protocol requirements**:
   - **For SSH**: The NetBird SSH server must be enabled on the target peer. Learn more about [enabling SSH access](/how-to/ssh).
   - **For RDP**: The RDP server must be enabled on the target machine
3. **Modern browser** - You're using an up-to-date version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari with WebAssembly support

## Accessing Machines via the Browser Client

### Quick Access from the Peers List

The easiest way to connect is directly from the Peers dashboard:

1. Navigate to the **Peers** section in your NetBird dashboard
2. Find the peer you want to access
3. In the **Remote Access** section, click the **SSH** or **RDP** button

</p>

### SSH Connection

When connecting via SSH:

1. Click the **SSH** button for your target peer
2. A credentials modal will appear

<Note>
    Before connecting via SSH, make sure that SSH Access is enabled both on the target peer and in the NetBird Dashboard. Learn more about [enabling SSH access](/how-to/ssh).

</p>

3. Adjust the SSH username in the credentials modal if required
4. Click **Connect**
5. A terminal window will open in your browser with your SSH session

</p>

### RDP Connection

For RDP access:

1. Click the **RDP** button for your target machine
2. A new window will open with a credentials modal - enter your RDP server credentials:

</p>

   - **Username**: Your username (can include domain: `DOMAIN\username`)
   - **Password**: Your password for the RDP server

3. Click **Connect**
4. In the same window, a certificate warning dialog will appear - review the certificate details

</p>

<Note>
    Certificate warnings appear for all RDP connections because the Browser Client cannot access the browser's native certificate store for validation. Accepted certificates are remembered using browser storage.
</Note>

5. Click **Accept and Continue** to proceed with the connection
6. The remote desktop will load in the window

## Connection Management

### Active Sessions

While connected through the Browser Client:

- **Session persistence**: Sessions remain active as long as the browser tab is open
- **Multiple connections**: Open multiple tabs for concurrent sessions to different peers
- **Clipboard support**: Copy and paste text between host and RDP in both directions

### Session Security

The Browser Client maintains NetBird's security standards:

- **End-to-end encryption**: All traffic is encrypted using WireGuard®
- **Temporary access**: Uses NetBird's temporary access mechanism that:
  - Creates short-lived peers with WireGuard keys generated in the browser
  - Establishes temporary ACL rules (TCP/22, TCP/3389)
  - Automatically removes the peer and ACLs when the session ends
- **No data persistence**: Keys and credentials exist only in browser memory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Connection Issues

**"Failed to initialize WASM"**
- Clear your browser cache and cookies
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check if your browser supports WebAssembly
- Try using a different browser

**"Connection timeout"**
- Check that the SSH/RDP services are running on the target

**"Authentication failed"**
- For RDP, try including the domain in the username (e.g., `DOMAIN\username`)

## Known Limitations

**RDP Compatibility**
- Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025 are currently not supported for RDP connections
- Use Windows 10 or earlier Windows Server versions for RDP access

**Browser Client Constraints**
- **Relay-only connections**: No direct P2P connections (may increase latency)
- **Advanced features**: Some SSH/RDP features are not available (SFTP, sound, file shares, etc.)
- **Concurrent connections**: Browser resource limits may affect multiple simultaneous sessions
- **RDP resolution changes**: Require reconnection (not seamless)

## Technical Implementation

For technical details on the Browser Client architecture, see the [Browser Client Technical Architecture](/about-netbird/browser-client-architecture) documentation.

### SSH Requirements

For SSH access through the Browser Client:

- **NetBird SSH must be enabled** on the target peer
- The browser generates WireGuard keys and pre-registers the peer via the temporary access endpoint
- Authentication uses the pre-generated WireGuard key pair (bypassing the usual OIDC or setup key flow)
- The WASM NetBird client handles SSH connections internally

### RDP Technology Stack

The RDP implementation is 100% client-side using:

- **[IronRDP](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP)**: High-performance Rust RDP client (Apache 2.0/MIT licensed)
- **RDCleanPath proxy**: IronRDP's rdp proxy reimplemented to make use of NetBird
- Both components are compiled to WebAssembly and run entirely in the browser

## Security Considerations

When using the Browser Client:

1. **Always connect from trusted devices** - The browser environment should be secure
2. **Use incognito/private mode** on shared computers to ensure no session data persists
3. **Log out properly** - Close the browser tab to ensure the session ends
4. **Keep your browser updated** to receive the latest security patches
5. **Be cautious with browser extensions** that might interfere with or monitor your sessions

The Browser Client provides a convenient, secure way to access your network resources without installing software, perfect for quick access from any device or when working from temporary workstations.
