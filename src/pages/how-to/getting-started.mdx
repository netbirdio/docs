This guide describes how to quickly get started with NetBird and create a secure private network with two connected machines.

One machine is a Linux laptop, and the other one a EC2 node running on AWS.
Both machines are running Linux but NetBird also works on Windows, MacOS nad popular mobile platforms like Android and iOS.

## Create a NetBird Account
Sign-up at [app.netbird.io](https://app.netbird.io/)
You can use your Google, GitHub or Microsoft account.

## Install NetBird

After a successful login you will be redirected to the ```Peers``` screen which is empty because you don't have any peers yet.

The `Add peer` window should automatically pop up, but if it doesn't, click ```Add new peer``` to add a new machine.

Choose your machine operating system (in our case it is ```Linux```) and proceed with the installation steps.

</p>

## Connect your Laptop

If you installed NetBird Desktop UI you can use it to connect to the network instead of running `netbird up` command.
Look for `NetBird` in your application list, run it, and click `Connect`.

</p>

At this point a browser window pops up starting a device registration process. Click confirm and follow the steps if required.

</p>

## Connect Your EC2 Node

On the EC2 node repeat the installation steps and run `netbird up` command.

```bash
sudo netbird up
   ```

Copy the verification URL from the terminal output and paste it in your browser. Repeat step #5

</p>

## Validate Connection

Return to ```Peers``` and you should notice 2 new machines with status ```online```

To test the connection you could try pinging devices:

On your laptop:
```bash
ping ec2-demo-node.netbird.cloud
   ```

On the EC2 node:
 ```bash
ping my-linux-laptop.netbird.cloud
   ```
Done! You now have a secure peer-to-peer private network configured.
