# SSH

NetBird provides secure SSH access to your peers through its built-in SSH server, allowing you to connect to remote machines without exposing SSH ports to the internet.

<Note>
    SSH Access is disabled by default and must be enabled both on the target peer and in the NetBird Dashboard.
</Note>


## Requirements

To use SSH access through NetBird, you need to enable SSH in two places:

1. **NetBird Client Settings** - Enable SSH on the target peer
2. **NetBird Dashboard** - Allow SSH access for the peer

## Enabling SSH

### Step 1: Enable SSH Server on Target Peer

On the machine you want to access via SSH:

1. Click on the NetBird tray icon
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Click on **Allow SSH** to enable the SSH server

If you are using the CLI, you can enable SSH by running:

```bash
netbird down # if NetBird is already running
netbird up --allow-server-ssh
```

### Step 2: Enable SSH in Dashboard

1. Log in to your NetBird Dashboard
2. Navigate to the target peer details page
3. Enable SSH access for the peer
4. Save the changes

## Using SSH

### CLI

For SSH access through the command line interface (CLI), refer to the [CLI documentation](/how-to/cli#ssh) for detailed instructions on establishing SSH connections using the NetBird CLI.

### Browser Client

For SSH access through the Browser Client, refer to the [Browser Client documentation](/how-to/browser-client#ssh-connection) for detailed instructions on establishing SSH connections directly from your web browser.
