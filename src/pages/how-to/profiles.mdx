# Switching Between NetBird Accounts with Profiles

NetBird supports multiple profiles on a single device, making it easy to switch between work, home, or other networks.
Only one profile is active at a time, and switching takes just a click.

This feature also allows you to switch between self-hosted and cloud-hosted NetBird accounts seamlessly without needing
to juggle multiple config files.

## NetBird Profiles GUI Quick Start

To get started with NetBird profiles:

- Upgrade your client application to the latest NetBird version.
- Run the GUI app

You will see a `default` profile created automatically.

Add more profiles by hovering over the default profile and clicking "Manage Profiles".
After adding a new profile, select it to make it active.

You can now change the NetBird settings, e.g., providing a self-hosted
instance URL or allowing SSH. The new settings will be saved in the new profile. Click "Connect" to bring up the new profile.

The consequent selection of your profiles from the menu will automatically trigger the NetBird client to connect to the network and authentication
if needed.

## Manage Profiles in the GUI

* **Add** a new profile with a friendly name input.
* **Delete** any inactive profile (trash icon).
* **Active and default** profiles cannot be removed.

## What Is a Profile?

A **profile** is your NetBird configuration bundle: WireGuard keys, login state, and network settings all in one file.
Think of it as a separate "NetBird account" on your machine:

- **Default profile**  
  Created automatically on first run or after upgrade.  
- **Custom profiles**  
  Any number of additional profiles you add yourself (e.g. `work`, `home`, `test`).

Profiles live in your system or user config folders:

| OS     | System-wide path                  | User path                                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux  | `/var/lib/netbird/profiles/...`   | `~/.config/netbird/<profile>.json`                    |
| macOS  | `/Library/Application Support/...`| `~/Library/Application Support/NetBird/<profile>.json`|
| Windows| `%ProgramData%\Netbird\profiles\` | `%APPDATA%\Netbird\<profile>.json`                    |

## Why Use Profiles?

- **Seamless switching** between multiple NetBird networks/accounts  
- **No manual config files updates**: all configs are managed through the CLI or GUI
- **Persistent state**: your last active profile reconnects on startup
- **Safe defaults**: you cannot remove the active/default profile by accident

---

## Upgrading From an Older Version

If you're upgrading from NetBird below version `0.52.0` that did not support profiles, here's what happens:

* During the first launch after the upgrade, your existing config `/etc/netbird/config.json` (or Windows equivalent) is automatically
copied to a new profile named  `default`.
* The `default` profile is set as active, and you can start using it immediately.

---

## Profile CLI Commands

With the CLI, you can manage profiles easily. The main command is:

```bash
netbird profile <add|list|select|remove> [name]
````

### Add a New Profile

To create a new profile, use the command:

```bash
netbird profile add <PROFILE_NAME>
```

For example, the command below creates a new profile named `work`:

```bash
netbird profile add work
```

This command does the following in teh background:

* Creates a `work.json` file in your config folder.
* Keeps the client disconnected until you run `netbird up` or `netbird login`.
* Will throw an error if the profile with the same name already exists.

### List Profiles

The command below lists all available profiles along with their status:

```bash
netbird profile list
```

For example, running this command might output:

```text
Found 3 profiles:
✓ work
✗ default
✗ home
```

* **✓** = active
* **✗** = inactive

### Select (Switch) a Profile

To switch to a specific profile, use:

```bash
netbird profile select <PROFILE_NAME>
```

For example, to switch to the `home` profile:

```bash
netbird profile select home
```

The successful command will output:

```text
Profile switched successfully to: home
```

If `home` hasn't been used before, you will need to run `netbird up` or `netbird login` to authenticate.
If the profile does not exist, you'll see an error message:

```text
Error: profile home does not exist
```

### Remove a Profile

To remove a profile, use:

```bash
netbird profile remove <PROFILE_NAME>
```

For example, to remove the `home` profile:

```bash
netbird profile remove home
```

If successful, you'll see:

```text
Profile removed successfully: home
```

You can't remove an active profile. If the profile your are trying to remove is active, you'll see an error:

```text
Cannot remove active profile: home
```

If the profile does not exist, you'll see an error message:

```text
Error: profile home does not exist
```

The command does the following in the background:

* Removes `home.json` and `home.state.json` files from your config folder.

---

### Using `--profile` Flags

You can use the `--profile` flag with any NetBird CLI command to specify which profile to use for that command.
This is useful for running commands in a specific context without switching profiles manually.

```bash
netbird up --profile work
netbird login --profile home
```

NetBird switches to the named profile then runs the command under the hood. If the profile is new and hasn't been used yet,
you'll be prompted to authenticate.
