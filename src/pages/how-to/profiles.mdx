# Switching Between NetBird Accounts with Profiles

NetBird supports multiple profiles on a single device, making it easy to switch between work, home, or other networks.
Only one profile is active at a time, and switching takes just a click.

This feature also allows you to switch between self-hosted and cloud-hosted NetBird accounts seamlessly without needing
to juggle multiple config files.

## NetBird Profiles Quick Start

To get started with NetBird profiles:

- Upgrade your client application to the latest NetBird version.
- Run the GUI app

You will see a "default" profile created automatically.

Add more profiles by hovering over the default profile and clicking "Manage Profiles".
After adding a new profile, select it to make it active.

You can now change the NetBird settings, e.g., providing a self-hosted
instance URL or allowing SSH. The new settings will be saved in the new profile. Click "Connect" to bring up the new profile.

The consequent selection of your profiles will automatically trigger the NetBird client to connect to the network and authentication
if needed.

## What Is a Profile?

A **profile** is your NetBird configuration bundle: WireGuard keys, login state, and network settings all in one file.
Think of it as a separate "NetBird account" on your machine:

- **Default profile**  
  Created automatically on first run or after upgrade.  
- **Custom profiles**  
  Any number of additional profiles you add yourself (e.g. `work`, `home`, `test`).

Profiles live in your system or user config folders:

| OS     | System-wide path                  | User path                                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux  | `/var/lib/netbird/profiles/...`   | `~/.config/netbird/<profile>.json`                    |
| macOS  | `/Library/Application Support/...`| `~/Library/Application Support/NetBird/<profile>.json`|
| Windows| `%ProgramData%\Netbird\profiles\` | `%APPDATA%\Netbird\<profile>.json`                    |

## Why Use Profiles?

- **Seamless switching** between multiple NetBird networks/accounts  
- **No manual config files updates**: all configs are managed through the CLI or GUI
- **Persistent state**: your last active profile reconnects on startup
- **Safe defaults**: you cannot remove the active/default profile by accident

## Upgrading from a Single-Config Setup

If you’re upgrading from NetBird < vX.Y:

1. On first launch, your old `/etc/netbird/config.json` (or Windows equivalent) is copied to a **`default`** profile.  
2. That “default” profile becomes your starting point.  
3. All future configs use the new profiles system—you don’t need to move anything yourself.

## Profile Commands: CLI Quick-Start

All profile actions live under:
```bash
netbird profile <add|list|select|remove> [name]
````

### 1. Add a Profile

```bash
netbird profile add work
```

* Creates `work.json` in your config folder.
* Initially disconnected until you run `netbird up` or `netbird login`.
* **Error** if `work` already exists.

### 2. List Profiles

```bash
netbird profile list
```

```text
Found 3 profiles:
✓ work
✗ default
✗ home
```

* **✓** = active
* **✗** = inactive

### 3. Switch Profiles

```bash
netbird profile select home
```

* If `home` isn’t configured yet, you’ll see it “connected” but need to run `netbird up` or `netbird login` to finish setup.
* **Error** if `home` does not exist.

### 4. Remove a Profile

```bash
netbird profile remove test
```

* Deletes `test.json` and `test.state.json`.
* **Cannot** remove the **active** or **default** profile—must switch first.

---

### Using `--profile` Flags

You can target a profile directly when bringing up or logging in:

```bash
netbird up --profile work
netbird login --profile home
```

Under the hood, NetBird switches to the named profile then runs the command. If the profile is new, you’ll be prompted to authenticate.

## Profile Management in the Desktop UI

The NetBird desktop app now mirrors all CLI profile features.

### Tray Menu

1. Click the NetBird icon in your system tray/menu bar.
2. See a list of profiles with the **active one highlighted**.
3. Click another profile to switch.
4. Select **+ Add Profile…** to create a new one.

### Manage Profiles Screen

* **Add** a new profile with a friendly name input.
* **Delete** any inactive profile (trash icon).
* **Active/default** profiles cannot be deleted—buttons are disabled or show an error.

After creating or removing profiles, the CLI immediately reflects those changes, and vice versa—everything uses the same underlying config files.
