# Provision Users and Groups From Microsoft Entra ID

[Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id),
formerly known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a cloud-based identity and access management service that
provide secure authentication, single sign-on, and user management capabilities for organizations.

To get started, navigate to [Integrations](https://app.netbird.io/integrations) in the left menu, which will take you to the `Identity Provider` integration.
Click the `Enter ID (Azure AD)` button. This action will trigger a pop-up window that will present you with a user-friendly
wizard, guiding you through the synchronization process between NetBird and Azure AD.
