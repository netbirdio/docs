## Changing a Subscription

Based on your current subscription plan, you have the flexibility to upgrade or downgrade at any time as your needs change. 

<Note>
Your subscription cycle starts on the first day of your original subscription. If you adjust your plan during the billing cycle, and since billing occurs at the end of the subscription month, you will be charged for the plan you are on at the end of the billing cycle.
