## Machine-based usage

NetBird offers scalable plans for networks with a machine-based usage model. This approach is relevant, among other scenarios,
for IoT use cases where there is a large number of machines on the network but comparatively fewer users.
This option is available under both Team and Business plans. Simply subscribe to the Team or Business plan, and we'll
automatically adjust the machine costs as detailed in the following sections.


### Inclusive machine allowance
- **Team and Business plans**: Start with 100 free machines and an extra 10 machines for each paid user.
- **Example**: a Team plan with 10 users provides:
- `(10 users × 10 machines/user) + 100 base machines = 200 machines`

### Additional machine billing
- Extra machines are billed at a set rate per machine.
- **Example**: Adding 20 extra machines to a Team plan with 10 users:
- Base plan cost: `(10 users × €5/user) = €50`
- Extra machines cost: `(20 extra machines × €0.5/machine) = €10`
- **Total monthly cost**: `€50 + €10 = €60`
