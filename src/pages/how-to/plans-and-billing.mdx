## Changing a subscription

Based on your current subscription plan, you have the flexibility to upgrade or downgrade at any time as your needs change. 

<Note>
Your subscription cycle starts on the first day of your original subscription. If you adjust your plan during the billing cycle, and since billing occurs at the end of the subscription month, you will be charged for the plan you are on at the end of the billing cycle.

## Machine-Based Usage

NetBird offers scalable plans for networks with a machine-based usage model. This approach is relevant, among other scenarios, for IoT use cases where there is a large number of machines on the network but comparatively fewer users.


### Inclusive Machine Allowance
- **Team and Business Plans**: Start with 100 base machines and an extra 10 machines for each paid user.
- **Example**: A Team Plan with 10 users provides:
  - `(10 users × 10 machines/user) + 100 base machines = 200 machines`

### Additional Machine Billing
- Extra machines are billed at a set rate per machine.
- **Example**: Adding 20 extra machines to a Team Plan with 10 users:
  - Base Plan Cost: `(10 users × €5/user) = €50`
  - Extra Machines Cost: `(20 extra machines × €0.5/machine) = €10`
  - **Total Monthly Cost**: `€50 + €10 = €60`

<Note>
We automatically add extra billing if you exceed your usage limit. 
</Note>

When this occurs, you'll find info on your usage overage dislplayed in your account:
