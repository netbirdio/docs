# Allow only approved peer into the network
In a VPN network, managing and controlling the access of peers is paramount to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

By selectively allowing machines to join, you can ensure that only authorized and trusted devices have access to sensitive data and resources.
This control helps in mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access or potential cyber threats.

Furthermore, controlling peer access is crucial in compliance with data protection regulations, as it ensures that only compliant devices and users can access and transmit sensitive information.

## Peer Approval
The 'Peer Approval' feature specifically enhances network security for peers added via [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/getting-started#running-net-bird-with-sso-login) by a user,
requiring administrator approval for these new peer connections. This does not apply to peers added via [setup key](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/register-machines-using-setup-keys).

Initially, a peer is only allowed limited communication with the management server, preventing access to any network-related information.
Administrators then can assess whether the peer is eligible to join the network.
This ensures that only peers with a legitimate purpose gain full network access, maintaining a secure and controlled network architecture.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the [Business & Enterprise Package](https://netbird.io/pricing) within the NetBird Cloud.
