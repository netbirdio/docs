# Allow only approved peer into the network
The 'Peer Approval' feature enhances network security for peers added via [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/getting-started#running-net-bird-with-sso-login) by a user,
requiring administrator approval before joining the network. This does not apply to peers added via [setup key](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/register-machines-using-setup-keys).

Initially, a peer is only allowed limited communication with the management server, preventing access to any network-related information.
Administrators then can assess whether the peer is eligible to join the network.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the [Business & Enterprise Package](https://netbird.io/pricing) within the NetBird Cloud.
