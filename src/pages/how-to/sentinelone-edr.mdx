# Restrict Network Access with SentinelOne Singularityâ„¢

[SentinelOne Singularity](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/) is an autonomous cybersecurity platform that provides
comprehensive endpoint protection, detection, and response capabilities. The SentinelOne agent runs on your devices (endpoints),
collecting and analyzing endpoint data to detect and respond to threats in real-time. The agent's presence on endpoints and the
security data it collects can be utilized to enforce access policies and limit network access according to the "health" status
of the endpoints.

The integration of NetBird with SentinelOne Singularity provides organizations with network security controls that allow
only IT-managed devices running SentinelOne to access the network. Additionally, the integration uses SentinelOne's threat
detection capabilities, enabling administrators to further limit network access based on the security posture of each device.

SentinelOne's endpoint protection provides real-time threat detection and automated response capabilities. By integrating with
SentinelOne Singularity, NetBird can ensure that only devices with active security monitoring and protection can access the network.

In this guide, we will walk you through the configuration steps to integrate SentinelOne Singularity with NetBird and use
endpoint security status to control network access for devices that meet your security requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating and configuring a SentinelOne integration, ensure that you have the following:
- A SentinelOne account with the permissions to create and manage API tokens.
  If you don't have the required permissions, ask your SentinelOne administrator to grant them to you.

## Create a SentinelOne API Token

- Navigate to your SentinelOne Management Console
- Go to **Settings** &raquo; **Users** &raquo; **Service Users**
- Click **Create Service User**
- Fill in the form:
  - Name: `NetBird Integration`
  - Description: (optional)
  - Expiration Date: Set your preferred expiration date
- Click **Next**
- Select Site and set Scope to **Viewer**
- Click **Create User**
- Copy the generated API token. You will need this token when configuring the integration in NetBird.
- Note your SentinelOne console URL from your browser's address bar (e.g., `https://your-tenant.sentinelone.net`)

## Configure a SentinelOne Integration in NetBird

- Navigate to the [Integrations &raquo; EDR](https://app.netbird.io/integrations?tab=edr) tab in the NetBird dashboard
- Click **Connect SentinelOne** to start the configuration wizard

</p>

- Enter your SentinelOne console URL (e.g., `https://your-tenant.sentinelone.net`)
- Enter the API token you created in the previous step
- Click **Continue** to verify the connection

- Select the groups you want to apply the integration to
- Click **Connect** to complete the integration setup

<Note>
    The EDR check will apply only to machines in the selected groups and will require a running SentinelOne agent.
</Note>
<Note>
    You can also use groups [synchronized from your Identity Provider (IdP)](/how-to/idp-sync).
</Note>

- Peers that have the SentinelOne agent installed and are actively monitored will be granted access to the network. 
  Peers without the agent will appear with an `Approval required` mark in the peers list and won't be able to access 
  the network until the agent is installed and reporting to SentinelOne.

</p>

- Optional. You can experiment and see how the integration works by decommissioning or disconnecting agents in the SentinelOne console:
    - Navigate to the **Sentinels** page in the SentinelOne Management Console
    - Select an agent you want to test with
    - Click **Actions** and then **Decommission** (or wait for an agent to go offline)
    - After about a minute, the peer will be disconnected from the network and marked as `Approval required` in the NetBird dashboard.
    - To restore access, reactivate or reconnect the agent in SentinelOne

<Note>
    NetBird synchronizes the list of devices managed by the EDR platform via the API about every minute.
    The changes might not be visible immediately.
</Note>

<Note>
    If you install the SentinelOne agent on a peer after it joined the network, you will need to disconnect and reconnect
    this peer for the `Approval required` mark to disappear.
