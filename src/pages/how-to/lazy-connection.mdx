# Overview
NetBird now includes an experimental lazy connection feature designed to improve performance and reduce resource usage by connecting to peers only when needed. Instead of maintaining always-on connections, NetBird activates them on-demand based on activity or signaling.

This guide walks you through enabling and configuring this feature in your NetBird client.

<Note>
    Minimum supported agent version: <strong>v0.45.0</strong>
</Note>

<Note>
    <strong>Self-hosted only:</strong> This feature also requires an upgraded NetBird management server. Make sure your server is updated to the <strong>v0.45.0</strong> version that supports lazy connections.
</Note>


## What Are Lazy Connections?

When enabled, Lazy Connections allow the NetBird agent to:

- Establish peer-to-peer connections **only when required** (e.g., when ping the remote peer).
- Monitor peer activity and **automatically disconnect peers** that remain inactive **and unreachable** for a specified time.
- Keep critical peers (such as routers or excluded peers) **always connected** to ensure uninterrupted communication.

This feature is especially useful in **large-scale deployments** or **resource-constrained environments**, where maintaining full-mesh, permanent connections to all peers is unnecessary and inefficient.

<Note>
    When using lazy connections, there may be a **slight delay** when initiating a connection to a peer that is not yet connected. This is expected behavior, as the connection is established on-demand.
</Note>


### How Automatic Disconnection Works

Once a connection between two peers is established, it will remain open **as long as the remote peer is reachable**. The connection is **not** closed just because there is no data transfer.

In other words, the inactivity timer only triggers a disconnect if the peer is both <em>inactive</em> and <em>unreachable</em> for the full duration of the threshold.

<Note>
    The default inactivity threshold is <strong>60 minutes</strong>, and can be configured via the <code>NB_LAZY_CONN_INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD</code> environment variable.
</Note>

Additionally, the disconnection logic is being improved and will be enhanced in future releases to better support mobile devicesâ€”providing more intelligent reconnection behavior and improved handling of intermittent connectivity.

## Enabling Lazy Connections

Lazy connections are disabled by default. To enable them:

You can enable Lazy Connections using the following environment variable:

```bash
export NB_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_LAZY_CONN=true
```

Or pass the flag directly via the CLI when running the agent:

```bash
netbird up --enable-lazy-connection
```
<Note> 
    This configuration is <strong>not persistent</strong>. You must reapply the flag or environment variable after each restart unless it is built into your service definition (e.g., systemd or Docker).
</Note>
