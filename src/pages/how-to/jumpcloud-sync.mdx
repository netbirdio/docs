# Provision Users and Groups From JumpCloud

JumpCloud is a comprehensive cloud-based directory platform that provides identity, access, and device management capabilities.
It offers features like single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and centralized user management
to help organizations secure and manage access to their resources.

NetBird's JumpCloud integration enhances user management by allowing you to utilize JumpCloud as your identity provider.
This integration automates user authentication in your network, adds SSO and MFA support, and simplifies network access management
to your applications and resources.

The integration process consists of two stages: first, you'll work with the NetBird support team to set up Single Sign-On (SSO)
from NetBird's login page using JumpCloud credentials. Next, you'll configure SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)
to synchronize users and groups seamlessly.

## Get Started with NetBird-JumpCloud Integration

To set up SSO and SCIM provisioning, go to `Integrations` in the NetBird admin console's left menu to access the Identity Provider integration page. Click the `Connect JumpCloud` button to get started with the JumpCloud-NetBird integration. This will open a pop-up window with detailed instructions on synchronizing NetBird and JumpCloud.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the integration process, ensure you have the necessary [admin permissions in JumpCloud](https://jumpcloud.com/support/admin-portal-roles). You need a JumpCloud user account with one of the following roles:

* Administrator (minimum required)
* Administrator with Billing

These roles have the required permissions to configure SSO applications and manage SCIM provisioning.

## Setting Up SSO with JumpCloud

Before configuring SCIM provisioning, you must first set up Single Sign-On (SSO) with JumpCloud. Please follow the detailed setup instructions in our [Single Sign-On guide for JumpCloud](/how-to/single-sign-on#jump-cloud).

Once SSO is configured and you can successfully log in to NetBird using your JumpCloud credentials, you can proceed with the SCIM setup below.

## Enabling JumpCloud SCIM in NetBird



### Configure SCIM Application in JumpCloud

In your [JumpCloud admin console](https://console.jumpcloud.com/), go to `SSO Applications`, select your `NetBird`
application, and then select the `Identity Management` tab.

In the **Configuration Settings** section, enter the following SCIM Service Provider details:

* **API Type**: `SCIM API` (default)
* **SCIM Version**: `SCIM 2.0` (default)
* **Base URL**: `https://api.netbird.io/api/scim/v2`
* **Token Key**: Paste the Bearer token you copied from NetBird
* **Test User Email**: Provide a new, unused email address for testing (e.g., `test@yourdomain.com`)

* Click `Test Connection` to verify the SCIM connection

If the connection is successful, you'll see a success message. Click `Activate` to enable SCIM provisioning.

## Configuring SCIM Provisioning to NetBird

On NetBird, click `Continue →`. You'll see instructions for configuring SCIM provisioning options.

Back in JumpCloud, configure the provisioning settings:

* Under the `Identity Management` tab in your NetBird application
* Enable the following options:
  * **Create Users**: Automatically create users in NetBird when assigned in JumpCloud
  * **Update User Attributes**: Sync user profile changes from JumpCloud to NetBird
  * **Deactivate Users**: Remove access when users are unassigned in JumpCloud
  * **Push Groups**: Synchronize JumpCloud groups to NetBird

Click `Save` when you're done.

## Assigning NetBird Application to JumpCloud Users and Groups

In NetBird, click `Continue →` to see the steps for assigning users and groups.

In JumpCloud admin console:

* Navigate to your NetBird SSO application
* Click on the `User Groups` tab
* Select the groups that should have access to NetBird

![JumpCloud Assign Groups](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/jumpcloud-sync/jumpcloud-assign-groups.png)

You can also assign individual users by clicking on the `Users` tab:

* Click `+` to add users
* Search for and select users to assign to NetBird
* Click `Save`

## Push JumpCloud Groups to NetBird

To synchronize groups from JumpCloud to NetBird:

* In your NetBird application in JumpCloud
* Go to the `Identity Management` tab
* Under `Group Management`, select `Push Groups`
* Choose which groups to sync to NetBird

![JumpCloud Push Groups](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/jumpcloud-sync/jumpcloud-push-groups.png)

Once configured, JumpCloud will automatically push the selected groups to NetBird.

## Verify Synchronization

Return to NetBird and click `Finish Setup`. You can verify the synchronization by navigating to `Team > Users` in the NetBird console.

![NetBird Verify Users](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/jumpcloud-sync/netbird-verify-users.png)

The users and groups listed in NetBird should match those you configured in JumpCloud.
