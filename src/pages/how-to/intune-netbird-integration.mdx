# Deploying NetBird with Intune

Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based endpoint management solution that manages user access to organizational resources and simplifies app and device management across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS/iPadOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows client devices. Working alongside Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), Intune forms a powerful identity and access management framework that organizations rely on to secure digital assets.

When combined, Intune and Microsoft Entra ID ensure that only managed and compliant devices can access email, Microsoft 365 services, Software as a service (SaaS) apps, and on-premises applications. This integration combines multiple security signals, such as user identity, device health, and location, to enforce organizational policies using Conditional Access capabilities.

NetBird enhances this security ecosystem by providing a WireGuard-based overlay network with Zero Trust Network Access capabilities. While Intune focuses on device compliance and application management, NetBird provides secure network connectivity through its point-to-point private network infrastructure. This creates a complementary security approach where:

- **Intune** verifies device compliance and manages application policies
- **Entra ID** provides identity verification and conditional access decisions
- **NetBird** establishes secure network pathways with granular access controls

This division of security responsibilities creates a comprehensive zero-trust implementation in which devices are verified as compliant before they can establish network connections to protected resources.

In this hands-on tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy NetBird with Intune to grant tailored access permissions for different teams.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Complete the tutorial [Provision Users and Groups From Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/microsoft-entra-id-sync) to ensure you can select Entra ID-managed users and groups within Intune.
- A [NetBird account](https://app.netbird.io) with administrative permissions to create and manage access policies.
- An active [Microsoft Intune license](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/licenses) (included with Microsoft 365 E3, E5, F1, F3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E3/E5, or Business Premium plans).
- An Intune admin user with at least the [Policy and Profile Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference#policy-and-profile-manager) built-in role (*Intune Administrator* role recommended for full control over advanced features)
- At least one device (Windows, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android, Linux) [enrolled in Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/quickstart-setup-auto-enrollment).

## Setting Up NetBird Access Policies for Team-Specific Permissions

[NetBird's Access Control Policies](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/manage-network-access) provide the foundation for implementing a zero-trust architecture with Intune. They enable you to define precise permissions based on user groups and resource categories. This ensures that team members can only access what they need for their specific roles.

These policies work in tandem with Intune's device compliance mechanisms, creating a powerful security layer where identity and device posture determine access rights to the network.

Let's create a policy that enables the `Development` team to access the `Servers` group.

- Log in to your NetBird management dashboard with administrative credentials
- Navigate to `Access Control > Policies` and click the `Add Policy` button in the upper right corner.
- Set the source group to `Development` (or the appropriate team group synchronized from Entra ID) and the destination group to `Servers`
- Configure the protocol and port settings based on required access patterns (e.g., TCP 22 for SSH access to servers)

![Create Access Control Policy](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/intune-netbird-integration/intune-01.png)

Provide a descriptive name for the policy, such as "Dev Team Server Access" that indicates its purpose, and click `Save` to create and activate the policy.

![New control access policy](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/intune-netbird-integration/intune-02.png)

This access policy will automatically apply to all devices enrolled in Intune that belong to users in the `Development` group (as synchronized from **Entra ID**), providing them secure access to designated resources while preventing lateral movement to unauthorized systems.

Moreover, users will only gain this network access when using compliant devices that meet your organization's security standards, creating a true zero-trust environment where user identity and device security status are verified before granting resource access.

> **Note**: For maximum security, create separate policies rather than overly broad policies for each distinct access requirement. This approach minimizes your attack surface by ensuring precise access controls aligned with job responsibilities.

With these access policies in place, we can now proceed to configure the automated deployment of NetBird through Intune, ensuring that all team members have the required secure connectivity client installed on their devices.

## Deploying NetBird as a Win32 App

Opt for Win32 app deployment over the Line-of-Business (LOB) method (described in the next section) when requiring advanced features such as specific detection rules, prerequisites, dependencies, or update supersedence.

### Preparing the `.intunewin` File

Using the Win32 method requires you to convert either NetBird's `.exe` or `.msi` installer to the `.intunewin` format. Here's an overview of the procedure using the `.exe` installer:

- Download the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool)
- Download your preferred NetBird Windows installer from the [NetBird installation documentation](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/installation#windows)
- Run the Content Prep Tool and follow the instructions to convert the NetBird installer to `.intunewin` format. You'll be asked about the source folder (usually where you downloaded the installer), the NetBird setup file you will use, and the output folder (where you want the `.intunewin` file to be saved).
- For detailed information on using the Win32 Content Prep Tool, refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/apps/apps-win32-prepare).
