# Provision Users and Groups From Microsoft Entra ID

[Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id),
formerly known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a cloud-based identity and access management service that
provide secure authentication, single sign-on, and user management capabilities for organizations.

NetBird's Microsoft Entra ID integration allows you to synchronize users and groups from Entra ID to NetBird.
You can then use these synchronized groups to create access policies, configure network, and automate onboarding and offboarding processes.

## Get Started with NetBird-Entra ID Integration

To get started, navigate to [Integrations](https://app.netbird.io/integrations) in the left menu, which will take you to the
`Identity Provider` integration. Click the `Enter ID (Azure AD)` button. This action will trigger a pop-up window that will
present you with a user-friendly wizard, guiding you through the synchronization process between NetBird and Azure AD.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration process, verify that you have the required permissions in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
Specifically, you will need an Azure user account with at least one of these roles:

* Application Administrator
* Cloud Application Administrator
* Global Administrator

To check your permissions:

* Log in to the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com).
* Navigate to Manage Microsoft Entra ID and click `View`.
* Expand the `Manage` tab and click on `Roles and administrators` in the left menu.
* Look for your username and verify if you're assigned any of the above roles.

If you don't have the required permissions, contact your Azure AD administrator to grant you the appropriate role before proceeding with the NetBird integration.

## Create and Configure a Microsoft Entra ID Application for NetBird Integration

Now that you have the required permissions, return to the NetBird dashboard. Click on the `Get Started` button to initiate the integration process.

A new wizard screen will appear, offering step-by-step instructions for creating and configuring your Microsoft Entra ID application. To simplify the process, the wizard also provides quick-copy buttons for essential information:

* Name
* Account Type
* Redirect Type
* Redirect URI

On the next screen, click on the `Application permissions` button, which will let you select the appropriate permissions for NetBird to function correctly with your Microsoft Entra ID environment.

![EntraID Request API Permissions](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/microsoft-entra-id-sync/zSkSGAm.png)

To assign user permissions:

* Locate the search bar at the top. Type `User.Read.All` into the search bar and press `Enter`.
* In the search results, click on the `User` tab to expand it and view the available permissions.
* Click on the checkbox to select and enable the `User.Read.All` permission.

![EntraID UserReadAll](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/microsoft-entra-id-sync/KHGbhqe.png)

The `User.Read.All` permission allows NetBird to read the full set of profile properties, group memberships, and reports of the signed-in user and other users in your organization.

Next, repeat the procedure. This time, search for `Group.Read.All` and click on the checkbox to enable it as shown below:

![EntraID GroupReadAll](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/microsoft-entra-id-sync/XDl3b7u.png)

Once done, click the `Add permissions` button. You will see a few warnings:

![EntraID API Permissions Warnings](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/microsoft-entra-id-sync/OGWQWVH.png)

Locate the `Grant admin consent for [Your Organization Name]` button (you’ll find it next to `+Add a permission` button). Click on it to grant the required permissions.

A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to verify this action. Review the permissions listed in the dialog and click `Yes` to confirm. Wait for the process to complete, this may take a few seconds.

Once finished, the status of the permissions should change to `Granted for [Your Organization Name]`. Verify that all selected permissions now show a green checkmark, indicating they've been successfully granted:

## Choose Users to Synchronize from Entra ID
After configuring group synchronization, you'll now set up user synchronization. Similar than before, NetBird is configured to synchronize all users from your Microsoft Entra ID by default.

* If you want to synchronize all users, you don't need to take any action, simply click the `Continue →` button.
* To synchronize only specific users, click the `+ Add user filter` button. This opens a new panel where you can set criteria to include or exclude users.

<Note>
    You can modify these synchronization settings later if necessary.

![NetBird Users Sync](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/microsoft-entra-id-sync/bpwW1Bn.png)

After configuring user and group synchronization, the setup wizard will finalize the process and you'll automatically return to the main Identity Provider screen.

On this screen, you'll see two key indicators of successful integration:

* The Microsoft Entra ID toggle will be switched on (enabled).
* Next to the toggle, you'll see a button with a status message saying `Synced a few seconds ago`.

These indicators confirm that:

* The integration between NetBird and Microsoft Entra ID is active.
* The initial synchronization has been completed successfully.
* NetBird will now automatically sync with your Microsoft Entra ID at regular intervals.

<Note>
    You can manually trigger a sync or adjust settings by clicking on the Microsoft Entra ID section in the Identity Provider screen
