# How to Setup NetBird to Access Your Home Network

This step by step guide describes how to quickly get started with NetBird and create access to your home network remotely. You will achieve a secure connection between your entire home network and NetBird, enabling remote devices to access local network resources through a single routing peer.

## Getting Started

1. Download and Install NetBird
    
    <Button href="https://app.netbird.io/install" arrow="right" children="Download NetBird" />
    

1. Connect your laptop
    
    NetBird comes with a Desktop UI application that can be found in the systray. If it hasn't automatically started, look for `NetBird` in the application list, run it, and click `Connect`:

    </p>
    
    <Note>
    Alternatively, you can run the `netbird up` command in the terminal.
    </Note>
    
    At this point a browser window pops up starting an interactive SSO login session that will register your laptop. You will be prompt to sign up and confirm your device registration:

    </p>
    
    After the registration is complete, proceed to the [**NetBird dashboard**](https://app.netbird.io/) to confirm that your laptop is in the network. You will see it in the `Peers` view.
    
2. Create a new [Network](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/networks) in the NetBird dashboard
    1. Go to the **Networks** tab in the side bar
    2. Click **Add Network** and give it a name such as “Home LAN”, and optionally add a description.

    <p>

    </p>

3. Define Your LAN as a network resource
    1. Click **Add Resource**.
    2. Enter a name like “Home Network” and the CIDR of your home network into the Address field (e.g `192.168.1.0/24`).
    3. Assign it to a Destination Group, create one called “home-lan” so you can write access policies using this group.
    4. Click **Add Resource**.

    <p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/add-resource-home-network.png" alt="add-resource-home-network"                 className="imagewrapper-big"/>
    </p>

<Note>
    Alternatively, if you do not want to allow access your entire home subnet, you can get more granular by only            allowing access to a single static IP address for your added resource (e.g `192.168.1.50/32`).
</Note>

4. Create an [Access Control Policy](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/manage-network-access) to allow peers to reach your LAN
    1. After adding your resource, click **Create Policy**.
    2. Set Source to the group of NetBird peers you trust (for example “All Users” or a dedicated “Home Devices” group).
    3. Set **Destination** to the “home-lan” group you made.
    4. For **Protocol**, choose All.
    5. Name it “Home LAN Access” and click **Add Policy**.

    <p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/add-policy-home-lan.png" alt="add-policy-home-lan"                       className="imagewrapper-big"/>
    </p>

5. Choose or provision a routing peer in your LAN
    1. Click **Add Routing Peer**.
    2. Pick any always-on machine on your home network (Windows, Linux, Mac, Docker, Raspberry Pi).
    3. Install the NetBird agent on it using a single-use setup key using the CLI installer.
    4. Ensure this machine has access to both the internet and your LAN subnet.
    5. Choose this machine as your routing peer and click **Continue** and **Add Routing Peer**.

    </p>

    <p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/add-routing-peer.png" alt="add-routing-peer-home-network"                      className="imagewrapper-big"/>
    </p>

6. Test the connection
    1. Pick any IP within your LAN, such as the IP of your NAS, printer, or another service and run:<br />
        `ping 192.168.x.x`
    2. A successful ping response confirms that your routing peer is correctly forwarding traffic and that NetBird is          providing seamless connectivity.

That’s it! You’ve mapped your entire home LAN into a NetBird Network. Any peer you’ve granted in your access policy will now securely route traffic to all devices on your home subnet via your routing peer, without opening any router ports or installing software on every device.
