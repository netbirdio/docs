# How to Setup NetBird to Access Home Network

This step by step guide describes how to quickly get started with NetBird and create secure access to your home network remotely.

## Getting Started

1. Download and Install NetBird

1. Connect your laptop
    
    NetBird comes with a Desktop UI application that can be found in the systray. If it hasn't automatically started, look for `NetBird` in the application list, run it, and click `Connect`:

    </p>
    
    <Note>
    Alternatively, you can run the `netbird up` command in the terminal.
    </Note>
    
    At this point a browser window pops up starting an interactive SSO login session that will register your laptop. You will be prompt to sign up and confirm your device registration:

    </p>
    
    After the registration is complete, proceed to the [**NetBird dashboard**](https://app.netbird.io/) to confirm that your laptop is in the network. You will see it in the `Peers` view.
    
2. Create a new Network in the NetBird dashboard
    1. Go to the **Networks** tab in the side bar
    2. Click **Add Network** and give it a name such as “Home LAN”, and optionally add a description.
    
3. Define Your LAN as a network resource
    1. Click **Add Resource**.
    2. Enter a name like “Home Network” and the CIDR of your home network into the Address field (e.g `192.168.1.0/24`).
    3. Assign it to a Destination Group, create one called “home-lan” so you can write access policies using this group.
    4. Click **Add Resource**.
    
4. Create an Access Control Policy to allow peers to reach your LAN
    1. After adding your resource, click **Create Policy**.
    2. Set Source to the group of NetBird peers you trust (for example “All Users” or a dedicated “Home Devices” group).
    3. Set **Destination** to the “home-lan” group you made.
    4. For **Protocol**, choose All (or restrict to TCP/UCP if you prefer).
    5. Name it “Home LAN Access” and click **Add Policy**.
    
5. Choose or provision a routing peer in your LAN
    1. Click **Add Routing Peer**.
    2. Pick any always-on machine on your home network (Windows, Linux, Mac, Docker, Raspberry Pi).
    3. Install the NetBird agent on it using a single-use setup key using the CLI installer.
    4. Ensure this machine has access to both the internet and your LAN subnet.
    5. Choose this machine as your routing peer and click **Continue** and **Add Routing Peer**.

That’s it! You’ve mapped your entire home LAN into a NetBird Network. Any peer you’ve granted in your access policy will now securely route traffic to all devices on your home subnet via your routing peer, without opening any router ports or installing software on every device.
