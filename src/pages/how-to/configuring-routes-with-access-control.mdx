# Configuring routes with access control
By default, network routes allow unrestricted access, meaning any traffic can flow through the routes without limitations.
This behavior occurs when access control groups are not associated with a route. However, when access control groups
are set, the route inherits access restrictions based on the defined policies. Only traffic that meets the criteria
specified in these policies can access the internal services, ensuring that your network remains secure and that
only authorized users can reach sensitive resources.

## Creating Access Control Policy
After accessing the `Access Control` > `Policies` tab, click on the `Add policy` button to create a new policy.
In the popup, specify source and destination groups, and add Posture Checks if needed. Make sure to set traffic
direction only when TCP or UDP protocols are selected. Finally, provide a name and description for your policy.

In the example below, we are creating a one direction policy with the following information:
- Name: `Devs to Servers`
- Description: `Devs are allowed to access servers`
- Protocol: `TCP`
- Ports: `80`
- Source Groups: `devs`
- Destination Groups: `servers`

</p>


If necessary, you can create new groups simply by entering new names in the input box for either the source or destination lists.

Once you have finished configuring the policy, click `Add Policy` to save it. You will then see your new policy in the table.

##  Creating a network route with access control group
Access the `Network Routes` tab and click the `Add Route` button to create a new route.

In the example below, we are creating a route with the following information:

- Network identifier: `aws-eu-central-1-vpc`
- Description: `Production VPC in Frankfurt`
- Network range: `10.10.0.0/16`
- Routing peer: `server`
- Distribution Groups: `devs`
- Access Control Groups: `servers`

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/network-route-acl.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/network-route-acl-group-settings.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

Once you fill in the route information, you can click on the `Add Route` button to save your new route.
<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/network-route-acl-saved.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

Done! Now, every peer connected to your routing peer can only access port 80 services on the routed network,
as specified by the defined policy.
