# Management SQLite Store

In NetBird, the management system traditionally relies on JSON file storage.
Starting from version 0.24.0, we have introduced **experimental** support for SQLite.
This addition aims to provide users with enhanced performance and scalability options.

## SQLite Entity Relationship Diagram

For a high-level overview of the SQLite schema, refer to the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) below:

## Using SQLite for Fresh Installations

As of version 0.24.0, the default configuration for fresh installations is JSON file storage. 
However, users have the option to leverage the benefits of SQLite for new instances. 
To enable SQLite, update your management.json as follows:

```json
    "StoreKind": "Sqlite",
```

Alternatively, you can explicitly set the store to JSON file storage:

```json
    "StoreKind": "JsonFile",
```

## Migration from JSON Store

Starting from version 0.24.0, NetBird management provides a subcommand to facilitate migration to SQLite:

```
$ netbird-mgmt sqlite-migration
Contains sub commands to perform filesotre to sqlite store migration and rollback

Usage:
  netbird-mgmt sqlite-migration [command]

Available Commands:
  down        Rollback SQLite store to JSON filestore. Please make a backup of the SQLite file before running this command.
  up          Migrate JSON file store to SQLite store. Please make a backup of the JSON file before running this command.

Flags:
      --datadir string   server data directory location (default "/var/lib/netbird/")
  -h, --help             help for sqlite-migration

Global Flags:
      --log-file string    sets Netbird log path. If console is specified the the log will be output to stdout (default "/var/log/netbird/management.log")
      --log-level string   (default "info")

Use "netbird-mgmt sqlite-migration [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Follow these steps for migration:

1. Stop NetBird management service.
2. Backup your data store (`store.json` in `datadir` - default "/var/lib/netbird/").
3. Run the migration to SQLite subcommand. Example: `netbird-mgmt sqlite-migration up --log-file console`
4. Enable SQLite in management following [the instruction in the previous section](#using-sq-lite-for-the-fresh-installation).
5. Run NetBird management service.


## Rollback to JSON File Store

To rollback to the JSON file store, follow these steps:

1. Stop the NetBird management service.
2. Backup your SQLite data store (`store.db` in `datadir` - default "/var/lib/netbird/").
3. Run the rollback to JSON file subcommand (Example: `netbird-mgmt sqlite-migration down --log-file console`).
4. Enable JSON file store in management following [the instructions for fresh installations](#using-sq-lite-for-the-fresh-installation).
5. Restart the NetBird management service.

This migration process allows users to seamlessly transition between storage options while maintaining data integrity. 
Ensure you perform backups before any migration or rollback operations.
