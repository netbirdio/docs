# NetBird MSP Portal for Managed Service Providers

NetBird Cloud offers a multi-tenant MSP Portal for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)
to manage customers (tenants) from a single place. As an MSP, you can manage multiple NetBird accounts under your organization,
configure network settings, billing, and control network access for each tenant just like you would for your own NetBird account.

An MSP account is a standard NetBird account with the added 'Tenants' section, allowing for the management of customer networks.
With an MSP account, you can also manage your own internal network, just like with a regular NetBird account.

The MSP Portal is designed to help you efficiently manage multiple tenant networks, providing a seamless experience for
switching between tenants and your MSP account. You can do so without the need to log in and out of different accounts
or inconvenient customer-specific URLs.

## How to Apply for an MSP Account?
To apply for an MSP account, follow these steps:

* Ensure you have an active NetBird subscription ([Team plan](https://netbird.io/pricing) or higher).
* Visit our MSP application form at [https://netbird.io/msp](https://netbird.io/demo?form=msp&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=msp-portal).
* Complete the application form with your details and company information.

Submit the form for review by our team. Our team will evaluate your application and, if approved, grant you MSP status
and access to the MSP Portal.

## Access the MSP Portal
Once approved as an MSP, you will see the 'Tenants' section in your NetBird dashboard.
You can now add new tenant accounts under your organization.

## Add New Tenants

In the 'Tenants' section of your dashboard, click on the 'Add Tenant' button to add a new tenant account.

1. Provide the tenant's name and domain:

</p>

2. Define who can access the tenant account by selecting user groups of your account. Only users from the selected groups will
be able to access the tenant account.

</p>

3. To ensure that you have rights to manage the tenant, you need to verify the ownership of the tenant domain by adding
a TXT DNS record to the tenant's domain:

</p>

4. Once the domain is verified, select a plan for the tenant. You can opt for the Free Trial if you'd like to demo your
product to the customer before committing to a paid plan.

<Note>
    If you want to add an existing NetBird account as a tenant, please write us at msp@netbird.io providing the
    tenant's owner email address.
</Note>

## Manage Tenants

Every user in your MSP account that has permissions to manage tenants can switch between the MSP account and tenant
accounts using the tenant switcher in the top right corner.

Choose the tenant you want to manage from the dropdown list to switch to the tenant account and the system will redirect
you to the tenant's network.

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/msp-portal/tenant-switch.png" alt="tenant-switch" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

<Note>
    If no tenants appear in the dropdown list, it may be because your user lacks the necessary permissions to manage tenants.
    Please verify that your user is assigned to the appropriate groups listed under the 'Permission Groups' column in the 'Tenants'
    table.
</Note>

Once you switch to a tenant account, you can manage the tenant's network settings, enable integrations, control network access, and more.
Your user will have the 'Admin' role within the tenant account, granting you full administrative access.

Note that your user will not appear in the 'Team' -> 'Users' section of the tenant account, as user management is handled
through the MSP account. However, your user will be visible in the Audit Log, labeled as 'External.'
