# MSP Portal: Manage Tenants from your NetBird Cloud account

NetBird's new MSP Portal feature allows Business Subscribed accounts of our Cloud offering to become Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and manage multiple tenant accounts directly from their account. 
This powerful functionality is currently in Beta and available to select accounts only.

## Applying for MSP Status
To become an MSP and access the Tenant management features:

* Ensure you have an active Business Subscription on NetBird Cloud.
* Visit our MSP application form at [MSP Application Form URL].
* Complete the application with your details and information.

Submit the form for review by our team. Our team will evaluate your application and, if approved, grant you MSP status and access to the MSP Portal.

## Accessing the MSP Portal
Once approved as an MSP, log in to your NetBird account with the Owner of user of your account. Navigate to the new "Tenants" section in the main dashboard and you'll see an overview of your managed tenants and be able to add new ones:

## Managing Tenant Accounts
As an MSP, you can:

- View all tenant accounts in a centralized dashboard.
- Switch between tenant environments seamlessly.
- Manage network configurations, access controls, and user permissions for each tenant.
- Monitor usage and performance across all managed tenants.

To switch between Tenants, and your own account, you'll find a dropdown on the top right corner of your dashboard:
