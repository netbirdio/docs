# Enable post-quantum security
Post-quantum security addresses the emerging threat of quantum computing to current encryption methods.
Traditional cryptographic algorithms are potentially vulnerable to quantum computers, which can solve complex problems much faster than classical computers.
This advancement necessitates the development of new cryptographic techniques that can withstand quantum attacks.
[Rosenpass](https://rosenpass.eu) is an example of such an innovation, offering a post-quantum secure protocol to protect VPN connections against these future threats.


## About Rosenpass
[Rosenpass](https://rosenpass.eu) is a post-quantum secure key-exchange protocol that enhances [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPNs against quantum computer attacks.
It employs advanced cryptographic methods, [Classic McEliece](https://classic.mceliece.org) and [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/), for robust security.
The software is [open-source](https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass) and designed for easy integration with existing WireGuard installations.
Rosenpass serves both as a specialized tool for WireGuard and a generic key exchange tool for other protocols, ensuring future-proof security against quantum threats.
<Note>
    NetBird uses a [Golang implementation](https://github.com/cunicu/go-rosenpass) of the Rosenpass protocol by the [cunÄ«cu](https://cunicu.li) project.

## Enable Rosenpass in NetBird
<Note>
    This is still an experimental feature and can only be enabled on desktop clients.
</Note>
Rosenpass can be enabled by setting a flag on client start-up.
```bash
netbird up --enable-rosenpass
```
As rosenpass respects a preshared key and uses this for it's initial key generation it is possible to define a preshared key as well.
```bash
netbird up --enable-rosenpass --preshared-key <preshared-key>
```
This configuration will be stored for future starts of the NetBird client.

<Note>
    If the Rosenpass feature is enabled on a peer it will only be able to communicate with other peers that have Rosenpass enabled.
</Note>

## Disable Rosenpass
To disable Rosenpass again use the following command.
```bash
netbird down
netbird up --disable-rosenpass=false
```
