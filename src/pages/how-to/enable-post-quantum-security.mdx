# Enable post-quantum security
Post-quantum security aims to mitigate risks associated with quantum computing's potential to undermine existing encryption methods.
Current concerns include the possibility of adversaries stockpiling encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it once quantum computers become capable.
This 'harvest and decrypt later' strategy threatens the confidentiality of presently secure communications.
[Rosenpass](https://rosenpass.eu), a post-quantum secure protocol, addresses these concerns by offering advanced cryptographic measures to protect VPN connections against such future threads.


## About Rosenpass
[Rosenpass](https://rosenpass.eu) is a post-quantum secure key-exchange protocol that enhances [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPNs against quantum computer attacks.
It employs advanced cryptographic methods, [Classic McEliece](https://classic.mceliece.org) and [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/), for robust security.
The software is [open-source](https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass) and designed for easy integration with existing WireGuard installations.
Rosenpass serves both as a specialized tool for WireGuard and a generic key exchange tool for other protocols, ensuring future-proof security against quantum threats by rotating WireGuard pre-shared keys every two minutes, continuously securing connections.

<Note>
    NetBird uses a [Golang implementation](https://github.com/cunicu/go-rosenpass) of the Rosenpass protocol by the [cunÄ«cu](https://cunicu.li) project.

## Enable Rosenpass in NetBird
<Note>
    This is still an experimental feature and is not supported on mobile devices.
</Note>
Rosenpass can be enabled by setting a flag on client start-up.
```bash
netbird up --enable-rosenpass
```
As rosenpass respects a preshared key and uses this for it's initial key generation it is possible to define a preshared key as well.
```bash
netbird up --enable-rosenpass --preshared-key <preshared-key>
```
This configuration will be stored for future starts of the NetBird client.

<Note>
    If the Rosenpass feature is enabled on a peer it will only be able to communicate with other peers that have Rosenpass enabled.
</Note>

## Disable Rosenpass
To disable Rosenpass again use the following command.
```bash
netbird down
netbird up --enable-rosenpass=false
```
