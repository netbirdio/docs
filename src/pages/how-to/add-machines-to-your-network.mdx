# Add peers to your NetBird network

Whether you have a network for personal use or manage your company's corporate network, you'd probably want to add machines
(or peers in NetBird's terms) to your network.

NetBird peer is a machine that runs the [NetBird agent](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works#client-application)
and is connected to the network. NetBird peer can be a virtual machine running in the cloud like AWS or Google Cloud,
an Android or iOS device, a personal laptop, a single-board computer like Raspberry Pi, a docker container, or even a router.

## Use NetBird web UI to add new peers

To add a new peer to your network follow these steps:
1. Sign-in to your NetBird account at https://app.netbird.io/ and go to the Peers tab.
2. Hit `Add Peer` button
