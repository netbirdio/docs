# Configure IPv6 support for your peers

In addition to IPv4, Netbird also supports both establishment of connections over IPv6 as well as assignment of IPv6 addresses 
to peers within the network.

<Note>
    Assignment of IPv6 addresses is available for NetBird [TODO] or later.
</Note>

<Note>
    Assignment of IPv6 addresses is currently only supported on Linux peers using the kernel Wireguard module and nftables firewall backend.
</Note>

## Configure IPv6 for a specific peer

To set the IPv6 setting of a specific peer, navigate to the peers tab and adjust the "IPv6 Support" setting using the dropdown menu.

</p>

There are three options for the peer's IPv6 status:
- **Force enabled:** Enable IPv6 for the peer regardless of group membership or configured routes.
- **Automatic (default):** Enable IPv6 for the peer if it is either...
    - ...a member of a group with the IPv6 setting enabled, or...
    - ...assigned as the routing peer of an IPv6 route.
- **Force disabled:** Disable IPv6 for the peer regardless of group memberships.

<Note>
    Force disabling IPv6 will disable all IPv6 routes configured for this peer.<br />
    After re-enabling IPv6, the routes will have to be re-enabled manually.
</Note>

The peer's IPv6 address can be seen both in the peers tab as well as the peer settings.

## Configure IPv6 for an entire group
Instead of enabling IPv6 manually for each peer, you can instead enable IPv6 for an entire group at once.

To enable IPv6 for an entire group, open the group settings and enable the IPv6 toggle in the table.

<p>

</p>

All peers that are a member of the group, support IPv6 and have their peer-specific IPv6 setting set to _Automatic_ will be given an IPv6 address.
