Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems play a critical role in network security by monitoring,
detecting, and responding to security threats in real-time. By aggregating and analyzing activity across the network,
SIEMs help identify anomalous patterns and potential breaches, providing a centralized view of security events.

NetBird provides an event streaming feature that allows you to stream network [activity events](/how-to/monitor-system-and-network-activity)
to third-party SIEM systems, such as [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/dg/security/siem-solution/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Amazon Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/firehose/), and others through a generic HTTP integration.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the cloud version of NetBird.
