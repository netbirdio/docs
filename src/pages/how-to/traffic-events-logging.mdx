# Traffic Events Logging

<Note>
This feature is available only in the cloud and on the Business plan.
It is an experimental feature, and its functionality and behavior may evolve, including changes to how data is collected
or reported.
To use this feature, ensure you have NetBird client version 0.39 or higher.
</Note>


The traffic events logging functionality enables comprehensive monitoring and analysis of connections across your infrastructure.
It captures network activity, including peer-to-peer, site-to-site, peer-to-resource, and other network traffic events.

It provides detailed visibility into connections and network traffic flow, helping to answer key questions such as who initiated
the connection, what resource was accessed, when it happened, where it originated, and why it was allowed. By enhancing
network monitoring capabilities, it strengthens security measures and delivers actionable operational insights, empowering
you to better manage and secure your environment.


## Enabling Traffic Events Logging

Traffic events logging is disabled by default. To enable it the NetBird dashboard, navigate to `Settings > Networks`.
Under the Experimental section, you’ll find the `Enable Traffic Events` option. Toggle the switch to enable traffic event logging.

By default, traffic reporting in userspace is always enabled, providing basic logging of network interactions.
However, packet size reporting at the kernel level is disabled by default to minimize CPU usage.

<Note>
You can optionally enable `Traffic Reporting (Kernel)` to capture additional details, such as network packet sizes,
at the kernel level. Be aware that enabling this option may lead to higher CPU usage on the NetBird client.

## Enable Traffic Events Streaming to SIEM Systems

NetBird allows you to stream traffic events directly to your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system in real-time.
By enabling this feature, you can seamlessly monitor and analyze NetBird network flow events within your existing SIEM infrastructure,
enhancing your ability to detect and respond to security events.
