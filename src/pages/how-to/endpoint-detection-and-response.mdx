# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

![Endpoint Detection and Response](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/endpoint-detection-and-response/edr-integrations.png)

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity technology designed to help organizations detect, investigate,
and respond to threats on endpoint devices. An endpoint is any device that is connected to a network, such as laptops,
desktops, smartphones, tablets, servers, and even some IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

With the rise of remote work, endpoints often operate outside the traditional corporate network perimeter,
making them more vulnerable to attacks. EDR provides a layer of security that is not dependent on the physical location
of the endpoint, thus extending protection to remote workers and their devices.

NetBird integrates with major EDR platforms to restrict network access only to devices managed by the company's IT department.
With the integration enabled, NetBird synchronizes the list of devices managed by the EDR platform via the API and
checks the presence of the EDR agent on the device, blocking access to the network if the agent is not installed.

NetBird doesn't apply the EDR checks to all devices in the network. Instead, you can select specific groups of devices for
the checks to apply.

<Note>
     This feature is only available in the cloud version of NetBird.
