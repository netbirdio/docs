# Provision Users and Groups From Google Workspace

[Google Workspace Identity](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/identity/overview-google-authentication)
is the system within Google Workspace that manages user authentication and access,
ensuring secure login and integration with other identity providers for Single Sign-On (SSO) and multi-factor authentication.

NetBird's Google Workspace integration allows you to synchronize users and groups from Google Workspace to NetBird and
automate network access management. With this integration, any changes to users and groups in Google Workspace are mirrored in NetBird,
granting new employees network access while immediately revoking access for former employees.

## Get Started with NetBird-Google Workspace Integration

To begin, go to [Integrations](https://app.netbird.io/integrations) from the left-hand menu, which will direct you to the `Identity Provider` section.
Select the `Google Workspace` option. A pop-up window will appear, launching an intuitive wizard that will lead you through the steps to synchronize
NetBird with Google Workspace.
