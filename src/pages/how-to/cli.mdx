# NetBird Agent command line interface (CLI)

The NetBird client installation adds a binary called `netbird` to your system. This binary runs as a daemon service to connect
your computer or server to the NetBirt network as a peer. But it can also be used as a client to control the daemon service.

This section will explore the commands available in `netbird`.
## Syntax
Use the following syntax to run `netbird` commands from your terminal window:
```shell
netbird [command] [subcommand] [flags]
```
* `command`: Specifies the operation that you want to perform or a top-level command: `up`, `login`, `down`, `status`, `ssh`, `version`, and `service`
* `subcommand`: Specifies the operation to be executed for a top-level command like `service`: `install`, `uninstall`, `start`, and `stop`
* `flags`:  Specifies optional flags. For example, you can use the `--setup-key` flag to specify the setup key to be used in the commands `login` and `up`

<Note>
    To see detailed command information, use the flag `--help` after each command
</Note>

## Global flags
`netbird` has a set of global flags that are available in every command. They specify settings that are core or shared between two or more commands, e.g. `--setup-key` is used by `login` and `up` to authenticate the client against a management service.

Below is the list of global flags:
```shell
      --admin-url string        Admin Panel URL [http|https]://[host]:[port] (default "https://app.netbird.io")
  -A, --anonymize               anonymize IP addresses and non-netbird.io domains in logs and status output
      --daemon-addr string      Daemon service address to serve CLI requests [unix|tcp]://[path|host:port] (default "unix:///var/run/netbird.sock")
      --log-file string         sets NetBird log path. If console is specified the the log will be output to stdout (default "/var/log/netbird/client.log")
  -l, --log-level string        sets NetBird log level (default "info")
  -m, --management-url string   Management Service URL [http|https]://[host]:[port] (default "https://api.wiretrustee.com:443")
  -p, --preshared-key string    Sets Wireguard PreSharedKey property. If set, then only peers that have the same key can communicate.
  -k, --setup-key string        Setup key obtained from the Management Service Dashboard (used to register peer)

```
### Environment Variables
Every flag of a `netbird` command can be passed as an environment variable. We are using the following rule for the environment variables composition:
* `PREFIX_FLAGNAME` and for flags with multiple parts: `PREFIX_FLAGNAMEPART1_FLAGNAMEPART2`
* The prefix is always **NB**
* The flag parts are separated by a dash ("-") when passing as flags and with an underscore ("_") when passing as an environment variable

For example, let's check how we can pass `--config` and `--management-url` as environment variables:
```shell
export NB_CONFIG="/opt/netbird/config.json"
export NB_MANAGEMENT_URL="https://api.self-hosted.com:33073"
netbird up
```
The `up` command would process the variables, read the configuration file on `/opt/netbird/config.json` and attempt to connect to the management service running at `https://api.self-hosted.com:33073`.

## Commands
### up
Single command to log in and start the NetBird client. It can send a signal to the daemon service or run in the foreground with the flag `--foreground-mode`.

The command will check if the peer is logged in and connect to the management service. If the peer is not logged in, by default, it will attempt to initiate an SSO login flow.
#### Flags
```shell
      --allow-server-ssh              Allow SSH server on peer. If enabled, the SSH server will be permitted
      --disable-auto-connect          Disables auto-connect feature. If enabled, then the client won't connect automatically when the service starts.
      --dns-resolver-address string   Sets a custom address for NetBird's local DNS resolver. If set, the agent won't attempt to discover the best ip and port to listen on. An empty string "" clears the previous configuration. E.g. --dns-resolver-address 127.0.0.1:5053 or --dns-resolver-address ""
      --enable-rosenpass              [Experimental] Enable Rosenpass feature. If enabled, the connection will be post-quantum secured via Rosenpass.
      --external-ip-map strings       Sets external IPs maps between local addresses and interfaces.You can specify a comma-separated list with a single IP and IP/IP or IP/Interface Name. An empty string "" clears the previous configuration. E.g. --external-ip-map 12.34.56.78/10.0.0.1 or --external-ip-map 12.34.56.200,12.34.56.78/10.0.0.1,12.34.56.80/eth1 or --external-ip-map ""
      --extra-dns-labels strings      Sets DNS labels. You can specify a comma-separated list of up to 32 labels. An empty string "" clears the previous configuration. E.g. --extra-dns-labels vpc1 or --extra-dns-labels vpc1,mgmt1 or --extra-dns-labels ""
  -F, --foreground-mode               start service in foreground
  -h, --help                          help for up
      --interface-name string         Wireguard interface name (default "utun100")
      --rosenpass-permissive          [Experimental] Enable Rosenpass in permissive mode to allow this peer to accept WireGuard connections without requiring Rosenpass functionality from peers that do not have Rosenpass enabled.
      --wireguard-port uint16         Wireguard interface listening port (default 51820)
```
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
netbird up
```
If you are running on a self-hosted environment, you can pass your management url by running the following:
```shell
netbird up --management-url https://api.self-hosted.com:33073
```
if you want to run in the foreground, you can use "console" as the value for `--log-file` and run the command with sudo:
```shell
sudo netbird up --log-file console
```
<Note>
    On Windows, you may need to run the command from an elevated terminal session.
</Note>
In case you need to use a setup key, use the `--setup-key` flag :
```shell
netbird up --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD
```
You can set extra DNS labels with the `--extra-dns-labels` flag:
```shell
netbird up --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD --extra-dns-labels vpc1,mgmt1 
```
<Note>
    This feature requires a setup-key with permissions to add peers with the extra labels.
</Note>
Multiple peers with the same extra labels will generate grouped DNS labels on the client side, and this feature can be used for DNS round-robing load balancing.

### login
Command to authenticate the NetBird client to a management service. If the peer is not logged in, by default, it will attempt to initiate an SSO login flow.
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
netbird login
```
If you are running on a self-hosted environment, you can pass your management url by running the following:
```shell
netbird login --management-url https://api.self-hosted.com:33073
```
In case you need to use a setup key, use the `--setup-key` flag:
```shell
netbird login --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD
```
Passing a management url and a setup key:
```shell
netbird login --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD --management-url https://api.self-hosted.com:33073
```

### down
Command to stop a connection with the management service and other peers in a NetBird network. After running this command, the daemon service will enter an `Idle` state.
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
netbird down
```

### status
Retrieves the peer status from the daemon service.
#### Flags
```shell
  -d, --detail                    display detailed status information in human-readable format
      --filter-by-ips strings     filters the detailed output by a list of one or more IPs, e.g., --filter-by-ips 100.64.0.100,100.64.0.200

<Note>
    The peer with IP `100.119.85.4` wasn't returned because it was not connected
</Note>

### ssh
Command to connect using ssh to a remote peer in your NetBird network.

You should run the ssh command with elevated permissions.
#### Flags
```shell
  -p, --port int   Sets remote SSH port. Defaults to 44338 (default 44338)
```
#### Arguments
The ssh command accepts one argument, `user@host`; this argument indicates the remote host to connect:
* `user`: indicates the remote user to login
* `host`: indicates the remote peer host IP address
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
sudo netbird ssh user@100.119.230.104
```
If you the remote peer agent is running the ssh service on a different port, you can use the `--port` or `-p` flag:
```shell
sudo netbird ssh -p 3434 user@100.119.230.104
```

#### Troubleshooting
When you try to connect via `netbird ssh <peer>`, errors can occur. Please enable `ssh` support when joining a peer to your account. 
```shell
netbird up --allow-server-ssh
```
This will allow the the `SSH Access feature` to work when enabled in the dashboard, under Peers > _your_peer_ > SSH Access.

    If you installed the service with `--disable-profiles`, this setting will persist and profiles will remain disabled after reconfiguration.
</Note>

### debug
The `debug` command provides tools for diagnosing and understanding the internal operations of the NetBird daemon.

#### Usage
To access debugging options:
```shell
netbird debug [command]
```
#### Subcommands
- `bundle`: Create a debug bundle that includes logs and system information for troubleshooting.
- `for`: Run the daemon with trace logging for a specified duration and create a debug bundle.
- `log`: Manage logging levels for the NetBird daemon.

#### Flags
```shell
  -h, --help   help for debug
```

### debug bundle
Generates a compressed archive containing diagnostic information, which can be used for troubleshooting.
The file will be generated in the a temporary directory and the path will be printed to the console.
The file is only accessible as root/Administrator.

#### Usage
To create a debug bundle:
```shell
netbird debug bundle [-A] [-S]
```

#### Examples
Create a debug bundle:
```shell
netbird debug bundle
```

This will output:
```
/tmp/netbird.debug.676945815.zip
```

#### Flags
```shell
  -h, --help        help for bundle
  -A, --anonymize   anonymize IP addresses and non-netbird.io domains in the debug output
  -S, --system-info Adds system information to the debug bundle
```

### debug for
Sets the logging level to trace, runs for the specified duration, and then generates a debug bundle.
This is useful for capturing detailed logs over a period where issues are occurring.

#### Usage
To run debugging for a specific time period:
```shell
netbird debug for <time> [-A] [-S]
```

#### Examples
Run debugging for 5 minutes and generate an anonymized debug bundle:
```shell
netbird debug for 5m
```

This will output something similar to:
```
Netbird up
Log level set to trace.
Netbird down
Netbird up
Remaining time: 00:00:01
Duration completed
Creating debug bundle...
Netbird down
Log level restored to INFO
/tmp/netbird.debug.3162242909.zip
```

#### Flags
```shell
  -h, --help        help for for
  -A, --anonymize   anonymize IP addresses and non-netbird.io domains in the debug output
  -S, --system-info Adds system information to the debug bundle
```


### debug log
This subcommand manages the logging level for the NetBird daemon during the current session.
The change in logging level is temporary and will revert back to the configured default upon daemon restart.

#### Usage
Adjust the logging level of the NetBird daemon:
```shell
netbird debug log level <level>
```

#### Available Levels
- `panic`: for panic level, the highest level of severity.
- `fatal`: for fatal level errors that cause the program to exit.
- `error`: for error conditions.
- `warn`: for warning conditions.
- `info`: for informational messages.
- `debug`: for debug-level messages.
- `trace`: for trace-level messages, which include more fine-grained information than debug.

#### Examples
Set the logging level to debug:
```shell
netbird debug log level debug
```

This will output:
```
Log level set successfully to debug
```
