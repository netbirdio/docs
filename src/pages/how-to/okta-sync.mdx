# Provision Users and Groups From Okta

[Okta](https://www.okta.com/) is a cloud-based identity management service that enables organizations to manage user authentication,
authorization, and access across a wide range of applications and services.

Like with [other IdPs](/how-to/provision-users-and-groups-from-idp), NetBird's IdP-Sync feature automates user access management by integrating with Okta and automatically
provisioning users and groups. This integration syncs changes from Okta to NetBird, ensuring that new users receive the
correct network access and that employees leaving the organization have their access immediately revoked.

## Get Started with NetBird-Okta Integration

To get started, navigate to [Integrations](https://app.netbird.io/integrations) in the left menu, which will take you to the `Identity Provider` integration.
Click the `Entra ID (Azure AD)` button. This action will trigger a pop-up window that will present you with a user-friendly
wizard, guiding you through the synchronization process between NetBird and Azure AD.

If your organization relies on Okta for managing employee access, automating access to NetBird via Okta's `Provisioning` feature can streamline your operations. This integration leverages `SCIM` (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) to ensure smooth synchronization of users and groups. For comprehensive insights into Okta's SCIM capabilities, please consult this [article](https://www.okta.com/blog/2017/01/what-is-scim/).

    NetBird will not be managed by SCIM.

<Note>
    Synced groups will only be available for membership and will not change the role of user in NetBird.
