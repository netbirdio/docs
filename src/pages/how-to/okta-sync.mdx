# Provision Users and Groups From Okta

Okta is a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) platform that centralizes user and customer profiles to enhance
security and streamline access. It offers features like multifactor authentication, single sign-on, and lifecycle
management to help organizations manage user identities effectively.

NetBird's Okta integration enhances user management by allowing you to utilize Okta as your identity provider.
This integration automates user authentication in your network, adds SSO and MFA support, and simplifies network access management
to your applications and resources.

The integration process consists of two stages: first, you’ll set up OpenID Connect (OIDC) to enable Single Sign-On (SSO)
from NetBird's login page using Okta credentials. Next, you’ll configure SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)
to synchronize users and groups smoothly.

## Get Started with NetBird-Okta Integration

To set up SSO, go to `Integrations` in the NetBird admin console's left menu to access the Identity Provider integration page. Click the `Connect Okta` button to get started with the Okta-NetBird integration. This will open a pop-up window with detailed instructions on synchronizing NetBird and Okta.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the integration process, ensure you have the [necessary permissions in Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/administrators-admin-comparison.htm). You need an Okta user account with one of the following roles:

* Super Admin
* Org Admin
* Group Admin

To check your user permissions in Okta:

* Log in to your Okta **admin** dashboard.
* Expand `People` in the left menu.
* Select your user.
* Navigate to the `Admin roles` tab.

Confirm that you have one of the required roles before proceeding with the integration.

## Installing the NetBird Integration

Once you have the necessary permissions, you can set up the NetBird application. First, on NetBird, click `Continue →` to show a summary of the necessary steps.


![NetBird Connect NetBird with Okta](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/dlgCUXo.png)

Let's go through them one by one:

* In Okta’s admin dashboard, click `Applications` in the left menu.
* Select `Applications` from the submenu.
* Click the `Browse App Catalog` button.


![Okta Browse App Catalog](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/fkSaYnn.png)

In the app catalog, enter "NetBird" in the search bar. Then, click the `Add Integration` button.


![Okta NetBird App](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/dgxJ916.png)

Accept the default application name and click the `Done` button. On the next screen, click the `Assign` dropdown and select `Assign to People`.


![Okta Assign People To NetBird App](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/WQ8O1l7.png)

You will see a list of users. Find your user account, click `Assign`, and save the changes. Verify your user is assigned to the NetBird app and click `Done`.


![Okta Verify User Added To NetBird](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/bteoM6j.png)

After that, you will see your user listed in the NetBird application.


![Okta User Added To NetBird App](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/IwaqFvj.png)

## Configuring SSO in Okta

The next step is to configure Okta-NetBird SSO integration.

In NetBird, click the `Continue →` button. A new wizard screen will appear, offering the instructions for retrieving Okta’s OpenID Connect credentials. You can click `Close` and navigate to Okta.


![NetBird Connect NetBird with Okta Sharing Credentials](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/AYVAbEy.png)

* Click on the `Sign On` tab on Okta. Look for `OpenID Connect` under `Sign on methods` in the `Settings` section.
* Copy the `Client ID` value.
* Copy the `Client Secret` value.

Store these credentials securely, as you will need them soon.


![Okta Copy Credentials](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/rl5Gelc.png)

* Click `Edit` in the `Settings` section.
* In `Credential Details`, change the `Application username format` from `Okta username` to `Email`.
* Click the `Save` button

![Okta OpenID Credential Details](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/FWPf0Cu.png)

* On the top right, click on your username
* Copy your [Okta account domain](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/find-your-domain/main/) as shown below:

![Okta Copy Domain](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/eITyobI.png)

The final step is to [send an email to the NetBird team](support@netbird.io) with the authentication information you just retrieved:

* Okta `Client ID`
* Okta `Client secret`
* Okta account domain
* Okta primary email domain (usually your username)

You will receive an email once the NetBird team enables authentication for your account.

This completes the first stage, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) from NetBird's login page using Okta credentials. Now, you can navigate to [app.netbird.io](app.netbird.io) and log in using [Okta Verify](https://help.okta.com/eu/en-us/content/topics/end-user/ov-overview.htm).

## Enabling Okta SCIM in NetBird

In NetBird, go to `Integrations > Identity Provider` and click on the `Connect to Okta` button.

![NetBird Connect to Okta](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/QbzudIU.png)

You will see a reminder of the permissions your user will require in Okta. Click the `Get Started →` button to continue.

![NetBird User Permissions](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/RBsJlzu.png)

If you haven't already, you'll need to set up SSO in Okta. If you've completed the previous section, skip this step and click the `Continue →` button.

![NetBird SSO in Okta](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/XYpJYW3.png)

The next screen will show you how to enable NetBird API credentials in Okta. Copy the value of the `Authorization (Bearer)` token.

* Similar than before when you assigned your user to NetBird app, click the `Assign` button
* This time, select `Assign to Groups`.
* Select Okta groups that you want to assign to the NetBird app.

![Okta Assign NetBird to Groups](/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/okta-sync/yGV0u5Y.png)

Once you assign the desired groups, click `Done`. You'll see the selected groups listed in Okta.

<Note>
    SCIM provisioning will manage only resources that are created through Okta. Any resources created directly in NetBird will not be managed by SCIM.
</Note>

<Note>
    Synced groups will only be available for membership and will not change the role of user in NetBird
