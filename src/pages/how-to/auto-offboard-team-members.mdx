# Automatically Offboard Team Members from NetBird

NetBird's IdP-Sync integration streamlines team member offboarding, enhancing security and efficiency by automatically revoking access when users are removed from your Identity Provider. Likewise, IdP-Sync integration helps restrict network and resource access when a team member is removed from a group or when an entire group is deleted from your Identity Provider. Let's walk through the process of offboarding users using this powerful feature.

## Removing Team Members

In this tutorial, we will focus on `user_01`, `user_02`, and `user_03`. From NetBird's `Users` dashboard, you can see that `user_01` is part of the `IT Administrators` group, while `user_02` and `user_03` belong to the `Staging` group.

To get started, access your Identity Provider (IdP) dashboard. For this example, we’ll use Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).

Next, locate the user you want to offboard in your IdP's user management section. Let’s say you want to revoke access to `user_01`, in that case, you will need to select it and click the `Delete` button as shown below.

After deletion, click the `Refresh` button to confirm that the user is no longer active.

Wait for the NetBird integration to complete its next synchronization cycle, which usually takes 300 seconds. Alternatively, go to the `Integrations` screen in the NetBird admin console and click the corresponding integration button to manually trigger the synchronization.

Now, go to NetBird's `Users` dashboard to verify that the user is no longer listed.

## Revoking Group Access

Imagine a scenario where you have an access policy that grants all members of the `Staging` group access to resources in the `Servers` group.

Let's say the current project is finished, and you no longer want members of the `Staging` group to have access to the `Servers` group. One way to do this is to remove the `Staging` group from your IdP.

Once the changes synchronize in NetBird, users and their group memberships will be updated; therefore, user permissions associated with that group will automatically be revoked.
