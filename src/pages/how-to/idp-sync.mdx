Managing private network access in a business environment is a critical yet often cumbersome task.
As companies grow and evolve, the manual process of granting access for new employees and revoking it for
departing ones becomes increasingly time-consuming and error-prone. This challenge strains IT resources, poses significant
security risks, and impacts productivity.

NetBird's IdP-Sync automates user access management to private networks by integrating with your identity provider (IdP)
and automatically provisioning users and groups. This integration ensures that changes to groups and users are
synchronized from your identity provider to NetBird, granting appropriate network access to new users and immediately
revoking access for departing employees.

NetBird allows you to use synchronized groups to create [access control policies](/how-to/manage-network-access#creating-policies),
or update network configurations like [DNS](/how-to/manage-dns-in-your-network#distribution-groups),
eliminating the need for manual grouping.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the cloud version of NetBird in the [Team plan](https://netbird.io/pricing) and above.
