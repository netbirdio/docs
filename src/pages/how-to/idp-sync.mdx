# Provision Users and Groups From Your Identity Provider

Managing user access to a private network in a business environment is a critical yet often cumbersome task.
As companies grow and evolve, the manual process of granting network access for new employees and revoking it for
departing ones becomes increasingly time-consuming and error-prone. This challenge strains IT resources, poses significant
security risks, and impacts productivity.

NetBird's IdP-Sync automates user access management by integrating with your identity provider (IdP) and automatically
provisioning users and groups. This integration ensures that changes to groups and users are
synchronized from your identity provider to NetBird, granting appropriate network access to new users and immediately revoking access for
departing employees.

NetBird allows you to use synchronized groups to create [access policies](/how-to/manage-network-access#creating-policies),
or update network configurations like [DNS](/how-to/manage-dns-in-your-network#distribution-groups),
eliminating the need for manual grouping.

<Note>
    NetBird's IdP-Sync is available from the Team plan and above.
