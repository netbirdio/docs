# Approve users
The user approval feature enhances security by requiring manual administrator approval before a user can join your NetBird organization via domain matching.

## Require user approval
Navigate to the Dashboard's `Settings` page and the `Authentication` tab and enable or disable `User Approval Required`.

- **Enabled**: Require manual approval for new users joining via domain matching. Users will be blocked until approved. Learn how to approve or reject users in the section [below](#approve-or-reject-user).
- **Disabled**: Manual approval for new users is not required. Users joining via domain matching will be automatically added to the organization.
