# Monitor System and Network Activity

The activity monitoring functionality in NetBird allows you to observe and track changes to your network infrastructure. This includes events such as when a new machine or user has joined your network, or when an access control policy has been modified.

## Access the Activity Monitoring View

The activity monitoring feature is enabled by default for every NetBird network. You can access the activity log in the web UI under the [Activity tab](https://app.netbird.io/activity). This view provides a centralized log of network events, and you can use the search bar to filter events by activity type.

The current version of NetBird tracks network changes that occur in the Management server, such as modifications to the list of peers, groups, system settings, setup keys, and access control policies. Future versions will also support connection events that occur in NetBird agents (e.g., peer A connected to peer B).

<Note>
    The `unknown` name or `unknown@unknown.com` email address may be displayed in the activity event store if the encryption key has been corrupted or lost. In this case, the events returned by the API could show `unknown@unknown.com` for the email address field and `unknown` for the name field.
    If the configuration files have been generated by the `configure.sh` script, you can find the previous encryption key in the backup files in the same folder as the script. Look for the <b>DataStoreEncryptionKey</b> field in the `management.json` backup file.
</Note>

## Enable Activity Event Streaming to SIEM Systems

NetBird can stream activity events to your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system in real-time. With this feature enabled, you can monitor and analyze NetBird network changes within your SIEM infrastructure. Check the [integrations guide](/how-to/activity-event-streaming) for more information about the supported integrations and how to enable them.
