# Homelab Use Cases

NetBird helps homelabbers securely access their home infrastructure from anywhere and connect multiple home networks together.

## Common Scenarios

- **Remote NAS Access**: Access your Synology, QNAP, or TrueNAS from anywhere
- **Home Automation**: Reach Home Assistant, smart home devices, and IoT systems remotely
- **Media Servers**: Stream from Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby while traveling
- **Family Network Sharing**: Connect your home network with family members' networks
- **Self-hosted Services**: Access Pi-hole, Nextcloud, and other self-hosted applications

## Getting Started

For connecting entire home networks (accessing devices that don't have NetBird installed), see the [Site-to-Site Connectivity Guide](/use-cases/site-to-site).

        },
    ]}
/>

## Recommended Setup

For most homelabbers, we recommend:

1. **Install NetBird on your devices** - Laptop, phone, and any servers you access directly
2. **Set up a routing peer** - Use a Raspberry Pi, NAS with Docker, or dedicated device
3. **Configure network access** - Use Networks (simpler) or Network Routes (more flexible)

| Scenario | Recommended Feature |
|----------|---------------------|
| Access home devices from laptop/phone | [Networks](/manage/networks) |
| Connect two home networks | [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes) |
| Run NetBird on router | [MikroTik Guide](/use-cases/homelab/client-on-mikrotik-router) |
