# Cloud Use Cases

Deploy NetBird across cloud environments to securely connect workloads, enable hybrid cloud connectivity, and simplify multi-cloud networking.

## Common Scenarios

- **Hybrid Cloud**: Connect cloud workloads to on-premise databases and services
- **Multi-Cloud**: Bridge AWS, GCP, and Azure environments without exposing traffic to the internet
- **Kubernetes**: Enable secure communication between clusters and external resources
- **Serverless**: Run NetBird on FaaS platforms for ephemeral, secure connectivity
- **Container Orchestration**: Deploy NetBird as a daemon set on ECS, EKS, or other container platforms

## Getting Started

For connecting cloud VPCs to on-premise networks, see the [Site-to-Site Connectivity Guide](/use-cases/site-to-site).

## Cloud Provider Considerations

### AWS
- Use VPC endpoints where possible for AWS services
- Security groups must allow traffic from NetBird routing peers
- Consider Auto Scaling groups with static ENIs for high availability

### GCP
- Enable IP forwarding on routing peer instances
- Firewall rules must allow traffic from routing peer internal IPs
- Use instance groups for redundancy

### Azure
- Enable IP forwarding on routing peer NICs
- Network security groups must allow routing peer traffic
- Consider Virtual Machine Scale Sets for HA
