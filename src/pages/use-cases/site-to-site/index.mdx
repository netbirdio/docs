# Site-to-Site Connectivity

Site-to-site connectivity allows you to connect entire networks together, enabling devices to communicate across locations without installing the NetBird client on every device.

## Understanding Remote Access Scenarios

NetBird supports three distinct remote access scenarios. Understanding which one you need is the first step to a successful setup.

### VPN-to-Site

A NetBird peer (device running the NetBird client) accesses devices on a remote network that don't have NetBird installed.

```
Your Laptop ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Routing Peer ──────► Office Printer
  (peer)                                    (peer)              (clientless)
```

**Common use cases:**
- Access your home NAS from anywhere
- Reach office servers while traveling
- Connect to IoT devices on a remote network

**Implementation:** Use [Networks](/manage/networks) (recommended) or [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes)

### Site-to-VPN

A device without NetBird initiates connections to NetBird peers. This is the reverse of VPN-to-Site—the clientless device starts the connection.

```
Office Server ──────► Routing Peer ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Your Laptop
 (clientless)           (peer)                                      (peer)
```

**Common use cases:**
- Office monitoring systems pushing data to remote analysts
- On-premise servers initiating backups to cloud peers
- Legacy systems that must initiate outbound connections

**Implementation:** Requires [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes) (Networks does not currently support this)

### Site-to-Site

Devices on separate networks communicate with each other, with neither running NetBird directly. Each network has a routing peer that handles traffic.

```
Home NAS ──► Routing Peer ──► NetBird Tunnel ──► Routing Peer ──► Office Server
(clientless)    (peer)                              (peer)         (clientless)
```

**Common use cases:**
- Connect branch office networks to headquarters
- Link home networks of family members
- Bridge on-premise data centers with cloud VPCs

**Implementation:** Requires [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes) (Networks does not currently support this)

### Exit Nodes

Exit nodes route all internet-bound traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`) through a designated peer, changing your apparent public IP address. Unlike the scenarios above, exit nodes handle internet egress rather than private network access.

```
Your Laptop ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Exit Node ──────► Internet
  (peer)                                     (peer)
```

**Common use cases:**
- Access region-restricted content while traveling
- Route traffic through a trusted network for compliance
- Mask your location for privacy

**Implementation:** Requires [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-scenario/exit-nodes)

## Which Scenario Do I Need?

| I want to... | Scenario | Feature to Use |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Access home devices from my laptop | VPN-to-Site | [Networks](/manage/networks/use-cases/by-scenario/access-home-devices) |
| Access office resources while traveling | VPN-to-Site | [Networks](/manage/networks/use-cases/by-scenario/remote-worker-access) |
| Let an office server connect to my laptop | Site-to-VPN | [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-scenario/site-to-site-office) only |
| Connect two home networks together | Site-to-Site | [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-scenario/site-to-site-home) only |
| Link branch offices | Site-to-Site | [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-scenario/site-to-site-office) only |
| Bridge cloud VPC with on-premise network | Site-to-Site | [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-scenario/site-to-site-cloud) only |
| Route all internet traffic through a specific peer | Exit Node | [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-scenario/exit-nodes) only |

## How It Works

All scenarios use a routing peer—a device running NetBird that forwards traffic for its local network:

1. **Deploy a routing peer** at each site (any device running NetBird with access to the local network)
2. **Configure routing** to advertise each site's subnet through NetBird
3. **Set access policies** to control which peers can reach which networks
4. **Configure clientless devices** to route traffic through the routing peer (for Site-to-VPN and Site-to-Site)

## Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Routing peer | A device running NetBird that forwards traffic for its local network |
| Clientless device | A device that doesn't run NetBird (printers, IoT, legacy systems) |
| Masquerade | NAT that hides source IPs behind the routing peer's IP (simplifies routing configuration on clientless devices) |

## Networks vs Network Routes

NetBird offers two features for routing traffic to private networks: [Networks](/manage/networks) (newer, simpler) and [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes) (original, more flexible). Both are fully supported and will continue to be maintained.

**Use Networks** for VPN-to-Site scenarios where you want a guided setup experience and per-resource access policies.

**Use Network Routes** when you need Site-to-VPN or Site-to-Site connectivity, or require advanced options like disabling masquerade.

### Scenario Support

| Scenario | Networks | Network Routes |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| VPN-to-Site | Yes | Yes |
| Site-to-VPN | No | Yes |
| Site-to-Site | No | Yes |

### Detailed Comparison

| Capability | Networks | Network Routes |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Setup complexity | Simpler, guided UI | More manual configuration |
| Distribution groups | Automatic (from policy sources) | Explicit configuration required |
| Extra routing peer policy | No (implied by resource policies) | Yes (must connect routing peers to distribution groups) |
| Per-route configuration | No (routing peers serve all resources) | Yes (each route needs peer, groups, range) |
| Edit resources after creation | Yes | No |
| Wildcard domains | Yes | No |
| Masquerade control | Always on | Configurable |
| Exit node support | No | Yes |

### Future Direction

The goal is to migrate all routing functionality into Networks for a unified experience. **Network Routes will not be deprecated without advance notice**, and any migration path will be documented. For now, use whichever feature fits your scenario.
