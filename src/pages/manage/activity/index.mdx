# Audit Events Logging

The Audit events logging functionality in NetBird allows you to observe and track changes to your network infrastructure.
This includes events such as when a new machine or user has joined your network, when access control policies have been modified,
and many other key network events.

## Access the Audit Events Logging View
The audit events logging feature is enabled by default for every NetBird network. You can access the activity log in the web UI under the [Audit Events tab](https://app.netbird.io/events/audit). This view provides a centralized log of network events. You can use the search bar to search by activity name, and apply filters for timeframes, event types, and users.

The current version of NetBird tracks a wide range of network changes that occur in the Management server, such as modifications to peers, groups, system settings, setup keys, and access control policies.

Future versions will also support connection events that occur in NetBird agents (e.g., peer A connected to peer B).

<Note>
    The `unknown` name or `unknown@unknown.com` email address may be displayed in the activity event store if the encryption key has been corrupted or lost. This issue is most relevant for self-hosted setups. In this case, the events returned by the API could show `unknown@unknown.com` for the email address field and `unknown` for the name field.
    
    If the configuration files have been generated by the `configure.sh` script, you can find the previous encryption key in the backup files in the same folder as the script. Look for the <b>DataStoreEncryptionKey</b> field in the `management.json` backup file.
</Note>

## Enable Audit Events Streaming to SIEM Systems

NetBird can stream audit events to your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system in real-time. With this feature enabled, you can monitor and analyze NetBird network changes within your SIEM infrastructure. Check the [integrations guide](/manage/activity/event-streaming) for more information about the supported integrations and how to enable them.
