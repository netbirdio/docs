# Stream Network Activity to Amazon Data Firehose

[Amazon Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/) is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift,
an other AWS services. You can use Amazon Data Firehose as a bridge between NetBird and other third-party providers that support Data Firehose
to ingest, transform and analyze your network activity events.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the cloud version of NetBird.

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating and configuring an Amazon Data Firehose event streaming integration, ensure that you have the following:
- An AWS account with the permissions to create and manage Data Firehose delivery streams.
- Permissions to create and manage IAM users, roles and policies.

If you don't have the required permissions, ask your AWS administrator to grant them to you.

## Create a Data Firehose Stream
- Navigate to the [Data Firehose Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/firehose/home)
- Click `Create Firehose stream`
- As source select `Direct PUT` and the desired destination
- Give it a descriptive name like `netbird-activity-events` and configure the stream to your needs

## Create an IAM User
- Navigate to the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
- Create an IAM User (for details see the [Amazon Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html))
- Create a custom policy with the following permissions (replace the resource with the ARN of your delivery stream):
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "firehose:PutRecord",
                "firehose:PutRecordBatch"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:firehose:region:accountID:deliverystream/netbird-event-streaming"
        }
    ]
}
```
- Attach the policy to the IAM user
- Select the user and navigate to the `Security credentials` tab
- Click `Create access key`
- Select `Third-party service` and click `Next`
- Give it a description
- Store `Access key` and `Secret access key` in a secure place. You will need these when configuring an integration in NetBird.

## Create an Integration in NetBird
- Navigate to the [Integrations &raquo; Event Streaming](https://preview.netbird.io/integrations) tab in the NetBird dashboard
