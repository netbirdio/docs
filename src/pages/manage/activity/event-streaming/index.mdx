Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems play a critical role in network security by monitoring,
detecting, and responding to security threats in real-time. By aggregating and analyzing activity across the network,
SIEMs help identify anomalous patterns and potential breaches, providing a centralized view of security events.

NetBird provides an event streaming feature that allows you to stream network [activity events](/manage/activity/traffic-events-logging)
to third-party SIEM systems, such as [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/dg/security/siem-solution/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Amazon Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/firehose/), and others through a generic HTTP integration.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the cloud version of NetBird.

This documentation provides step-by-step guides and best practices for integrating NetBird activity event streaming with
supported third-party platforms. To get started, select one of the following integrations:

- [Datadog](/manage/activity/event-streaming/datadog)
- [Amazon S3](/manage/activity/event-streaming/amazon-s3)
- [Amazon Data Firehose](/manage/activity/event-streaming/amazon-firehose)
- [SentinelOne Data Lake](/manage/activity/event-streaming/sentinelone-data-lake)
- [Generic HTTP](/manage/activity/event-streaming/generic-http)
