# Stream Network Activity to Amazon S3

[Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service.
You can use Amazon S3 to store and analyze large amounts of data, including network activity events from NetBird.

NetBird integrates with Amazon S3 and sends activity events to an S3 bucket in real-time once they occur. For every event,
NetBird creates a new object in the S3 bucket, which you can then analyze, filter, and query using Amazon tools.

Storing one event per object is not the most efficient way to save data in S3, therefore NetBird provides an
[alternative integration](/manage/activity/event-streaming/amazon-firehose) that uses Amazon Data Firehose for a more efficient
data ingestion.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the cloud version of NetBird.

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating and configuring an Amazon S3 event streaming integration, ensure that you have the following:
- An AWS account with the permissions to create and manage S3 buckets.
- Permissions to create and manage IAM users, roles and policies.

If you don't have the required permissions, ask your AWS administrator to grant them to you.

## Create an S3 Bucket
- Navigate to the [S3 dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
- Select the correct region in the top menu
- Click `Create bucket`
- Give it a descriptive name like `netbird-activity-events`
- (Optional) Change bucket configurations to your needs
- Click `Create bucket`

## Create an IAM User
- Navigate to the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
- Create an IAM User (for details see the [Amazon Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html))
- Create a custom policy with the following permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::netbird-activity-events/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
- Attach the policy to the IAM user
- Select the user and navigate to the `Security credentials` tab
- Click `Create access key`
- Select `Third-party service` and click `Next`
- Give it a description
- Store `Access key` and `Secret access key` in a secure place. You will need these when configuring an integration in NetBird.

## Create an Integration in NetBird
- Navigate to the [Integrations &raquo; Event Streaming](https://preview.netbird.io/integrations) tab in the NetBird dashboard

</p>

- Enable and configure the `Amazon S3` integration
- First select the region your S3 bucket is created in
<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/activity/event-streaming/amazon-s3/s3-region-select.png" alt="s3-region-select" className="imagewrapper" />
</p>
- Then enter the S3 bucket name you created in [Step 1](#step-1-create-an-s3-bucket) and click `Next`
<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/activity/event-streaming/amazon-s3/s3-bucket-name.png" alt="s3-bucket-name" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>
- Enter the `Access key` and `Secret access key` you created in [Step 2](#step-2-create-an-iam-user) and click `Connect`
<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/activity/event-streaming/amazon-s3/s3-iam-credentials.png" alt="s3-iam-credentials" className="imagewrapper" />
</p>

## Verify the Integration

After configuring the integration in NetBird, you can verify that the integration is working correctly by checking
the S3 bucket for newly created objects. If the integration is successful, you should see two `.json` files in your bucket
containing the following events:

- `integration test`
- `integration created`

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/activity/event-streaming/amazon-s3/verify-amazon-s3-integration.png" alt="verify-amazon-s3-integration" className="imagewrapper-big" />
</p>

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-04-11T19:01:05.381074+02:00",
    "message": "integration test",
    "id": 0,
    "initiator_id": "netbird",
    "target_id": "netbird",
    "meta": null,
    "reference": ""
}
```

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-04-11T19:01:08.769292+02:00",
    "message": "integration created",
    "id": 0,
    "initiator_id": "netbird",
    "target_id": "netbird",
    "meta": null,
    "reference": ""
}
```

The integration test event is sent to validate whether the provided credentials are correct and NetBird can stream events.
The integration created event is sent when the integration is successfully created.

The integration is now set up and ready to stream network activity events to Amazon S3.
