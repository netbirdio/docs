# Deploying NetBird with Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud

Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud serves as the centralized management hub for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and enterprise IT departments, delivering comprehensive cybersecurity and data protection through a unified platform. Acronis' Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) functionality enables IT professionals to efficiently oversee client networks, automate maintenance tasks, and remotely deploy software across Windows, macOS, and Linux machines at scale. This software deployment capability becomes particularly powerful when MSPs need to install security solutions, such as NetBird, across multiple client environments without requiring manual intervention on each endpoint.

NetBird offers a WireGuard-based overlay network with Zero Trust Network Access capabilities, integrating seamlessly with RMM deployment workflows. Once Acronis RMM handles the automated installation and initial configuration, NetBird delivers secure network connectivity through its peer-to-peer private network infrastructure with zero ongoing manual configuration requirements. This integration creates a streamlined operational approach where:

- **Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud** automates NetBird installation, manages updates, and maintains deployment compliance across client networks
- **NetBird** establishes secure network pathways with granular access controls and direct encrypted connections
- **Combined solution** delivers automated Zero Trust networking deployment with centralized management capabilities

This approach allows MSPs to deploy comprehensive Zero Trust security solutions efficiently while maintaining centralized control over both installation processes and ongoing network access policies.

In this hands-on tutorial, you'll learn how to use Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud software deployment capabilities to install and configure NetBird across Windows and macOS machines, creating secure, manageable network environments for distributed teams.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A [NetBird account](https://app.netbird.io) with administrative permissions to create and manage access policies.
- NetBird's Windows installer (`exe` or `.msi`) downloaded from the [NetBird installation documentation](https://docs.netbird.io/get-started/install/windows)
- An active [Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/products/cloud/cyber-protect/) subscription like [Cyber Protect Advanced](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/support/documentation/AcronisCyberProtect_15/index.html#editions-and-licensing.html).
- Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud Agent [installed and registered on all target Windows and macOS machines](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/support/documentation/AcronisCyberProtect_15/index.html#installation-overview.html).
- Administrative access to the Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud Console with [permissions to manage software deployment and device policies](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/support/documentation/AcronisCyberProtect_15/index.html#adding-administrators-acronis-account.html).
- At least one Windows and one macOS device listed in the **All devices** screen in Acronis Protect Cloud.

## Setting Up NetBird Access Policies for Team-Specific Permissions

[NetBird's Access Control Policies](https://docs.netbird.io/manage/access-control/manage-network-access) let you implement a zero-trust security approach alongside Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud. They enable you to define precise permissions based on user groups and resource categories, ensuring that team members can only access what they need for their specific roles. This granular approach aligns with MSP requirements for managing multiple client environments with distinct access requirements.

These policies work in tandem with Acronis RMM's monitoring and management capabilities. While Acronis monitors system compliance and maintains device health, NetBird enforces network-level access restrictions based on predefined group memberships.

For example, let's create an access policy. While the steps are the same for macOS, this demonstration will use a Windows group for simplicity. Our goal is to enable the `IT Administrators` team to access the `Windows Workstations` group:

- Log in to your NetBird management dashboard with administrative credentials
- Navigate to `Access Control > Policies` and click the `Add Policy` button in the upper right corner.
- Set the source group to `IT Administrators` and the destination group to `Windows Workstations`
- Configure the protocol and port settings based on required access patterns (e.g., TCP 22 for SSH access to servers, TCP 80 for web servers, etc.)

![Access Control Policy settings](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-01.png)

Provide a descriptive name for the policy, such as "IT to Windows machines" that indicates its purpose, and click `Save` to create and activate the policy.

![Access Control Policy name](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-02.png)

This access policy will automatically apply to all devices managed by Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud that belong to users in the `IT Administrators` group, providing them secure access to designated resources while preventing lateral movement to unauthorized systems. The policy enforcement occurs at the network level, complementing Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud's device-level monitoring and management capabilities.

![Access Control Policy list](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-03.png)

Moreover, users will only gain this network access when their devices are actively monitored and maintained through Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud, creating a comprehensive security approach where device health monitoring and network access controls work together. This combination ensures that only properly managed and compliant devices can establish secure network connections to protected resources.

> **Note**: For maximum security, create separate policies rather than overly broad policies for each distinct access requirement. This approach minimizes your attack surface by ensuring precise access controls aligned with job responsibilities and reducing complexity in multi-client MSP environments.

With these access policies configured, you can now proceed to use Acronis' software deployment capabilities to install NetBird across your managed Windows machines, ensuring that all team members have the required secure connectivity client automatically deployed and configured.

## Installing NetBird in Windows using Acronis Packages

This section demonstrates how to create a software package in Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud and deploy NetBird across your managed Windows machines using automated installation commands.

### Adding the NetBird Installer Package to Acronis

Log in to Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud, navigate to `SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT > My packages` and click the `Add package` button:

![Add package](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-04.png)

In the `General information` tab, provide a descriptive name for the package (e.g., "NetBird EXE Installer") and specify the vendor name. Optionally, add a package description and select the appropriate license type from the dropdown menu. Click `Next` to continue.

![General information](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-05.png)

In the `Upload package` tab, enter the installer version (required field) and select the target architecture type. Click the `+ Upload` button in the top right corner to upload the NetBird installer package.

![Upload package](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-06.png)

Select the NetBird installer file from your local system. Once the upload completes, click `Next` to proceed.

![Upload package](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-07.png)

In the `Install / Uninstall commands` tab, configure the silent installation parameters by entering the following commands:

- **Installation options:** `"{{full_path}}" /S`
- **Uninstallation options:** `{{uninstall_cmd}} /S`

The `/S` parameter ensures silent installation without user prompts for NetBird's EXE installer, while `{{full_path}}` and `{{uninstall_cmd}}` are Acronis variables that automatically resolve to the correct paths during deployment. Click `Next` when ready.

> **Note**: If you're using NetBird's MSI installer instead of the EXE installer, use `/qn` in the **Installation options** field instead of `"{{full_path}}" /S`. The **Uninstallation options** field remains the same (`{{uninstall_cmd}} /S`) for both installer types. The `/qn` parameter provides quiet installation with no user interface for MSI packages.

![Install / Uninstall commands](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-08.png)

In the `Summary` tab, review all package configuration details for accuracy. Check the required boxes to confirm your settings and accept the End User License Agreement (EULA) terms. Click `Next` to proceed.

![Summary](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-09.png)

The `Digital signature check` tab provides security verification options for the uploaded package. Enable digital signature checking to ensure package integrity and authenticity—this represents a security best practice for enterprise deployments. Click `Add package` to complete the package creation process.

![Digital signature check](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-10.png)

Acronis will perform the digital signature verification automatically. Once completed, you'll see a `Verified` status next to the NetBird package in your software library.

![My packages list](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-11.png)

With the NetBird package successfully added to your Acronis software library, you can now proceed to deploy it across your managed Windows machines.

### Deploying the NetBird Package to Windows Endpoints

Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud provides multiple deployment methods for installing NetBird across your managed Windows machines, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your operational workflow and scheduling requirements.

**Method 1: Direct Installation from Package Library**

To install NetBird from the available packages, navigate to `SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT > My packages` and click the three-dot menu next to the NetBird package. Select `Install` from the dropdown options.

![Install NetBird from My packages](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-12.png)

In the `Deploy software` window, click `+ Add workloads` and select your target machines from the available endpoints.

![Add workloads](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-13.png)

For this example, we selected a single endpoint called `Windows-11`. Click the `Install now` button to begin the immediate deployment process.

![Windows-11 Workload](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-14.png)

Monitor the installation progress by navigating to `MONITORING > Activities`, where you can track the deployment status across all selected machines.

![Activities menu](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-15.png)

Verify successful installation by navigating to `SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT > Software inventory`, where NetBird should appear in the installed software list for each target machine.

![Software inventory](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-16.png)

**Method 2: Bulk Selection from Device Management**

Alternatively, navigate to `DEVICES > All devices` and select the checkboxes for all target endpoints you want to include in the deployment. Click on any selected device to open the right sidebar, then select `Deploy software`. This approach opens the same `Deploy software` interface with your pre-selected workloads ready for deployment.

![Install NetBird from All devices](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-17.png)

**Method 3: Scheduled Deployment Plans**

For more advanced deployment control, use Acronis' deployment plans feature. Navigate to `MANAGEMENT > Software deployment plans` and click `+ Create plan` in the upper right corner.

![Software deployment plans](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-18.png)

In the `Create software deployment plan` window, click the pencil icon to customize the plan name, select either `Install` or `Uninstall` under Action, and click `Select software` to add the NetBird package. Configure your preferred deployment schedule by setting the specific date and time for automated execution.

![Create software deployment plan](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-19.png)

After configuring the plan parameters, click `Create` to save the plan for future use, or click `+ Add workloads` to immediately select target endpoints and execute the deployment.

![Selecting workloads](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-20.png)

The advantage of deployment plans is that they enable scheduled, repeatable installations across multiple client environments, allowing MSPs to standardize NetBird deployments during designated maintenance windows while maintaining consistent configuration management across all managed endpoints.

## Installing NetBird in Windows using a PowerShell Script

In addition to packages, Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud allows you to install NetBird using PowerShell scripts. This method is handy to automate NetBird installation on Windows Servers, especially if you plan to use [setup keys](https://docs.netbird.io/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys). 

### Adding NetBird PowerShell Scripts to Acronis

To add a new PowerShell script, navigate to `MANAGEMENT > Script repository` and click the `Create script by using AI` button.

Paste the following script into the IDE:

```shell
# NetBird Windows Installation Script
# Requires Administrator privileges

param(
    [string]$SetupKey = "",
    [string]$ManagementUrl = "",
    [switch]$Silent = $true
)

# Check if running as Administrator
if (-NOT ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) {
    Write-Error "This script requires Administrator privileges. Please run as Administrator."
    exit 1
}

try {
    # Define variables
    $TempDir = $env:TEMP
    $NetBirdInstaller = "$TempDir\netbird-installer.exe"
    
    # Get the latest release URL from GitHub API
    Write-Host "Fetching latest NetBird release information..."
    $ReleaseInfo = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest"
    
    # Find Windows installer (look for .exe file)
    $WindowsAsset = $ReleaseInfo.assets | Where-Object { $_.name -like "*windows*" -and $_.name -like "*.exe" }
    
    if (-not $WindowsAsset) {
        Write-Error "Could not find Windows installer in latest release"
        exit 1
    }
    
    $DownloadUrl = $WindowsAsset.browser_download_url
    Write-Host "Found installer: $($WindowsAsset.name)"
    
    # Download the installer
    Write-Host "Downloading NetBird installer..."
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $DownloadUrl -OutFile $NetBirdInstaller
    
    # Install NetBird
    Write-Host "Installing NetBird..."
    if ($Silent) {
        $InstallArgs = "/S"  # Silent installation flag for NSIS-based installers
        Start-Process -FilePath $NetBirdInstaller -ArgumentList $InstallArgs -Wait -NoNewWindow
    } else {
        Start-Process -FilePath $NetBirdInstaller -Wait
    }
    
    # Verify installation
    $NetBirdPath = "C:\Program Files\NetBird\netbird.exe"
    if (Test-Path $NetBirdPath) {
        Write-Host "NetBird installed successfully at: $NetBirdPath" -ForegroundColor Green
        
        # Start NetBird service if it exists
        $Service = Get-Service -Name "NetBird*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        if ($Service) {
            Write-Host "Starting NetBird service..."
            Start-Service $Service.Name
        }
        
        # Connect with setup key if provided
        if ($SetupKey) {
            Write-Host "Connecting NetBird with setup key..."
            $ConnectArgs = @("up", "--setup-key", $SetupKey)
            if ($ManagementUrl) {
                $ConnectArgs += @("--management-url", $ManagementUrl)
            }
            & $NetBirdPath $ConnectArgs
        }
        
    } else {
        Write-Error "Installation verification failed. NetBird not found at expected location."
        exit 1
    }
    
} catch {
    Write-Error "Installation failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    exit 1
} finally {
    # Cleanup
    if (Test-Path $NetBirdInstaller) {
        Remove-Item $NetBirdInstaller -Force
    }
}

Write-Host "NetBird installation completed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

The script automatically downloads the latest `.exe` installer from the official releases page and installs it using the silent flag.

Next, on the right sidebar:

- Enter a descriptive name for the script (e.g., NetBird EXE Script)
- Ensure the `Language` is set to `PowerShell` and the `Operating system` is `Windows`. 
- If needed, Acronis lets you pass `Arguments` to the installer, such as setup keys and the management URL.
- Once done, set the script's status to `Approved` and click `Save`. 

![Add NetBird EXE PowerShell script](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-22.png)

Using a similar procedure, you can add the following script to use the MSI installer instead of the EXE installer:

```shell
# NetBird MSI Installation Script
# Requires Administrator privileges

param(
    [string]$SetupKey = "",
    [string]$ManagementUrl = "",
    [switch]$UseLatestRelease = $true
)

# Check if running as Administrator
if (-NOT ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) {
    Write-Error "This script requires Administrator privileges. Please run as Administrator."
    exit 1
}

try {
    # Define variables
    $TempDir = $env:TEMP
    $NetBirdMSI = "$TempDir\netbird-installer.msi"
    
    if ($UseLatestRelease) {
        # Get the latest release from GitHub API
        Write-Host "Fetching latest NetBird release information..."
        $ReleaseInfo = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest"
        
        # Find MSI installer
        $MSIAsset = $ReleaseInfo.assets | Where-Object { $_.name -like "*windows*" -and $_.name -like "*.msi" }
        
        if (-not $MSIAsset) {
            Write-Error "Could not find Windows MSI installer in latest release"
            exit 1
        }
        
        $DownloadUrl = $MSIAsset.browser_download_url
        Write-Host "Found MSI installer: $($MSIAsset.name)"
    } else {
        # Use the direct package repository URL
        $DownloadUrl = "https://pkgs.netbird.io/windows/msi/x64/netbird_installer_windows_amd64.msi"
        Write-Host "Using direct package repository URL"
    }
    
    # Download the MSI installer
    Write-Host "Downloading NetBird MSI installer from: $DownloadUrl"
    try {
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $DownloadUrl -OutFile $NetBirdMSI -UseBasicParsing
        Write-Host "Download completed successfully"
    } catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to download MSI installer: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        exit 1
    }
    
    # Verify MSI file was downloaded
    if (-not (Test-Path $NetBirdMSI)) {
        Write-Error "MSI installer file not found after download"
        exit 1
    }

    # Build MSI installation arguments
    $MsiArgs = @(

        "/qn",           # Quiet mode, no user interface
        "/norestart",    # Do not restart automatically
        "/L*v", $LogFile # Verbose logging
    )

            }
            
            # Connect with setup key if provided and not already configured via MSI properties
            if ($SetupKey -and -not $MsiArgs.Contains("SETUP_KEY")) {

The script executes `netbird_uninstall.exe` using the silent flag to remove NetBird from Windows endpoints.

If you need to edit or delete any script, you can do it by navigating to `MANAGEMENT > Script repository > My scripts`

### Deploying NetBird Scripts to Windows Endpoints 

As with packages, you can use different methods to deploy NetBird scripts to Windows endpoints:

**Method 1: Quick Run from My scripts**

Navigate to `MANAGEMENT > Script repository > My scripts`, click the three-dot menu on the script you want to install, and select `Script quick run`:

![Script quick run](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-25.png)

Next, you can select the workloads where you want to run the script and click the `Run now` button.

![Run Script](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-26.png)

As before, you can follow the installation progress by navigating to `MONITORING > Activities`.

**Method 2: Scheduled Scripting Plans**

Navigate to `MANAGEMENT > Scripting plans` and click on `Create plan`. Next:

- Click on the little “pencil” icon to provide a name to the plan.
- Choose the script to run, the schedule to run it, and the maximum duration
- Add the desired workloads
- Once ready, click the `Create` button.

![Create Scripting Plan](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-windows-27.png)

From `MANAGEMENT > Scripting plans`, you can click on the three-dot menu of any plan to view its details, edit it, or manually run it.

## Installing NetBird in macOS using a Bash Script

For large-scale deployments, you can automate the NetBird client installation on multiple macOS endpoints using a Bash script. This method downloads the official package directly from NetBird's GitHub releases and proceeds with the installation.

You can optionally use NetBird's [setup keys](https://docs.netbird.io/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys) to pre-authorize devices during provisioning. The key ensures that once a machine joins the network, it is automatically placed in the correct groups with all the right access permissions already applied.

### Adding NetBird Bash Scripts to Acronis

Download the most recent NetBird macOS installer script using the following command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh > install.sh
```

The script downloads the latest macOS package (`.pkg`) from the official NetBird releases page and perform a silent, unattended installation.

Next, from the Acronis console, go to `MANAGEMENT > Script repository` to create a new script for your macOS devices. Select the `Create script by using AI` option and paste the script code into the editor.

Configure the following properties in the right sidebar:

* **Name:** Enter a descriptive name for the script (e.g., `macOS Install Script`).
* **Language settings:** Ensure the `Language` is set to `Bash` and the `Operating system` is `macOS`.
* **Arguments:** If needed, you can pass parameters to the script through the `Arguments` field, such as setup keys for automated enrollment.
* Once configured, set the script's status to `Approved` and click `Save`.

If you need to manage your scripts, you can do it by navigating to `MANAGEMENT > Script repository > My scripts`

### Deploying NetBird Scripts to macOS Endpoints 

Once the script is saved, you can run it on-demand from `My scripts` or add it to a scripting plan to schedule its execution

**Method 1: Quick Run from My scripts**

* Navigate to `MANAGEMENT > Script repository > My scripts`.
* Find the macOS script you created, click the three-dot menu icon next to it, and select `Script quick run`.
* In the pop-up that opens, select the target macOS devices (workloads) for the installation.
* Click `Run now` to deploy the script to the chosen devices.
* To track the installation status, go to `MONITORING > Activities`.

![Quick Run NetBird Bash Script script](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-macos-02.png)

**Method 2: Scheduled Scripting Plans**

This method allows you to automate the script's execution on a recurring basis.

First, navigate to `MANAGEMENT > Scripting plans` and click `Create plan`.  In the configuration window, set up the following options:
 
* **Name the plan:** Click the pencil icon to enter a descriptive name.
* **Choose what to run:** Select your macOS script from the list.
* **Define the schedule:** Set the desired frequency, time, and maximum allowed runtime for the script.
* **Select targets:** Add the macOS devices (workloads) that will be part of this plan.

Once all settings are configured, click `Create` to save and activate the plan.

![Quick Run NetBird Bash Script script](/docs-static/img/manage/for-partners/acronis-windows-netbird-integration/acronis-macos-03.png)

Tip: You can manually trigger any plan outside its schedule. Go to `MANAGEMENT > Scripting plans`, find the plan you want to execute, click its three-dot menu, and run it.

## Confirming Endpoint Registration in NetBird

While Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud handles the automated deployment of NetBird clients to your Windows and macOS endpoints, client authentication operates independently through NetBird's identity provider integration system. NetBird [supports major Identity Providers (IdP)](https://docs.netbird.io/manage/team/add-users-to-your-network#identity-provider-id-p-sync), including Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, Okta, and others, allowing organizations to maintain their existing authentication infrastructure.

For example, organizations using Microsoft 365 can use the [NetBird-Microsoft Entra ID integration](https://docs.netbird.io/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync#get-started-with-net-bird-entra-id-integration) to automatically authenticate and synchronize users and groups from Entra ID to NetBird. This integration eliminates manual user provisioning by automatically syncing organizational structure, including group memberships and user access permissions. Once synchronized, users automatically inherit the corresponding Access Control Policies created in the initial configuration section (`IT Administrators` group has access to the `Windows Workstations` group), ensuring that network access permissions align with their organizational roles.

To confirm that your Acronis-deployed Windows (or macOS) endpoints successfully joined NetBird, navigate to the `Peers` menu in your NetBird dashboard. Successfully registered endpoints will appear in the peers list with their device names, connection status, and assigned IP addresses within your NetBird network. 

This verification step ensures that your automated deployment process has completed successfully and that devices are ready to enforce the access control policies configured for your organization's security requirements.
