# Networks Use Cases

These guides show how to use the [Networks](/manage/networks) feature for VPN-to-Site access—where NetBird peers access devices on remote networks that don't have NetBird installed.

## What is VPN-to-Site?

VPN-to-Site allows a device running NetBird (like your laptop) to access devices on a remote network (like your home or office) without installing NetBird on every device.

```
Your Laptop ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Routing Peer ──────► Target Device
  (peer)                                    (peer)              (no NetBird)
```

**Example scenarios:**
- Access your home NAS from a coffee shop
- Reach office servers while traveling
- Connect to IoT devices on a remote network

<Note>
Networks supports VPN-to-Site only. For Site-to-VPN (clientless devices initiating connections) or Site-to-Site (connecting two networks), use [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases).
</Note>

## Why Use Networks?

Networks is the recommended approach for VPN-to-Site because it offers:
- **Simpler setup** - Streamlined UI workflow
- **Per-resource access control** - Define policies for specific resources
- **Built-in routing peer redundancy** - Easy high-availability configuration

    ]}

## Need More Than VPN-to-Site?

If your scenario requires:
- Clientless devices initiating connections (Site-to-VPN)
- Two networks communicating with each other (Site-to-Site)
- Disabling masquerade for source IP preservation

See [Network Routes Use Cases](/manage/network-routes/use-cases) instead.
