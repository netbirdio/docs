# Remote Worker Access (VPN-to-Site)

This guide shows how to enable remote workers to securely access office resources using the Networks feature.

## What You'll Achieve

After following this guide, employees will be able to access office servers, applications, and services while working remotely—without exposing those resources to the internet.

```
Remote Laptop ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Routing Peer ──────► Office Server
   (peer)                                    (at office)          (no NetBird)
```

## Prerequisites

- A [NetBird cloud account](https://app.netbird.io/) or [self-hosted instance](/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart)
- Admin access to office network infrastructure
- A server or VM at the office to serve as the routing peer

## Step 1: Connect a Remote Worker Device to NetBird

If you haven't already, install NetBird on a remote worker's laptop and connect:

1. Download NetBird from [app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
2. Run the application and click **Connect** in the system tray
3. Complete the sign-up process in your browser
4. Verify the device appears in the [NetBird dashboard](https://app.netbird.io/) under **Peers**

## Step 2: Add the Remote Worker to a User Group

1. In the **Peers** section of the dashboard, select the remote worker's device
2. Under **Assigned Groups**, add a new group: `remote-workers`

</p>

## Step 3: Find Your Office Subnet

Before configuring NetBird, identify your office network's subnet.

**On your routing peer device, run:**

```bash
# Linux
ip route | grep -E "^[0-9]"

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-NetRoute | Where-Object { $_.DestinationPrefix -like "*.*.*.*/*" }
```

Look for your local subnet, typically something like `10.0.0.0/24` or `192.168.1.0/24`.

## Step 4: Create a Network for Office Resources

1. Go to **Networks** in the NetBird dashboard
2. Click **Add Network**
3. Name it "Office LAN" and click **Save**

</p>

## Step 5: Add Your Office Subnet as a Resource

1. In your new network, click **Add Resource**
2. Enter a name like "Office Subnet"
3. Enter your office subnet (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`)
4. Create a group called `office-lan` for the destination
5. Click **Add Resource**

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/networks/by-scenario/remote-worker-access/add-resource-office-subnet.png" alt="Add resource" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

<Note>
For more granular access, add specific server IPs instead of the entire subnet. For example, add `10.0.0.50/32` to only allow access to a specific file server.
</Note>

## Step 6: Create an Access Policy

1. After adding your resource, click **Create Policy**
2. Set **Source** to "`remote-workers`"
3. Set **Destination** to `office-lan`
4. Set **Protocol** based on needs (TCP for most apps, All for full access)
5. Name it "Remote Worker Office Access" and click **Add Policy**

</p>

## Step 7: Set Up the Routing Peer

The routing peer forwards traffic from NetBird to your office network. Choose an always-on server at your office:
- A dedicated Linux VM
- A Windows Server
- A Docker container on an existing server

**Install NetBird on your routing peer:**

1. In the NetBird dashboard, go to **Setup Keys**
2. Create a new setup key (one-time use recommended). Add `office-lan` to **Auto-assigned groups** and click **Create Setup Key**.

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/networks/by-scenario/remote-worker-access/create-new-setup-key-office-lan.png" alt="Create setup key" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

<Note>
You can also add groups to peers manually after setup. Go to **Peers**, select the peer, and add groups under **Assigned Groups**.
</Note>

3. On your routing peer, run:

```bash
# Linux
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh
sudo netbird up --setup-key YOUR_SETUP_KEY

# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.ps1" -OutFile "install.ps1"; .\install.ps1
netbird up --setup-key YOUR_SETUP_KEY
```

4. In the Networks view, click **Add Routing Peer** on your Office LAN network
5. Select your new peer and click **Add Routing Peer**

## Step 8: Test the Connection

From the remote worker's laptop (connected outside the office network):

```bash
ping 10.0.0.1  # Your office router
ping 10.0.0.50 # Your file server or other device
```

Remote workers can now access office resources from any location.

## Step 9: Onboard Additional `remote-workers`

For additional remote workers:

1. Have employees install NetBird from [app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
2. After they connect, go to **Peers** and select their device
3. Under **Assigned Groups**, add them to the "`remote-workers`" group

Alternatively, create a setup key with "`remote-workers`" as an auto-assigned group for streamlined onboarding.

## Best Practices for Business Deployments

### Access Control

- Create specific groups for different access levels (e.g., `it-admins`, `sales`, `engineering`)
- Use protocol restrictions (e.g., only allow RDP to certain servers)
- Implement time-limited setup keys for contractor access

### High Availability

For critical connections, consider:
- Multiple routing peers at each location
- Monitoring routing peer health
- Automatic failover configuration

### Security

- Enable [Posture Checks](/manage/access-control/posture-checks) to verify device compliance
- Use [Activity Logging](/manage/activity) to audit access
- Implement MFA through your identity provider

## Troubleshooting

**Remote workers can't access office resources:**
1. Verify the routing peer is online and connected
2. Check access policies include the user's group
3. Ensure the routing peer can reach office resources locally

**Slow performance:**
1. Check routing peer placement—it should have good network connectivity
2. Consider enabling [lazy connections](/manage/peers/lazy-connection) for large deployments
3. Review network route priorities if multiple routes exist

## Next Steps

- **Need Site-to-VPN or Site-to-Site?** If office systems need to initiate connections to remote workers, or you need to connect branch offices, see [Network Routes Use Cases](/manage/network-routes/use-cases)
- **Advanced configuration:** See [Advanced Configuration](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-configuration/advanced-configuration) for masquerade options and detailed access control
