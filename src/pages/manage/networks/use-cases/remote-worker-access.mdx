# Remote Worker Access (VPN-to-Site)

This guide shows how to enable remote workers to securely access office resources using the Networks feature.

## What You'll Achieve

After following this guide, employees will be able to access office servers, applications, and services while working remotely—without exposing those resources to the internet.

```
Remote Laptop ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Routing Peer ──────► Office Server
   (peer)                                    (at office)          (no NetBird)
```

## Prerequisites

- A [NetBird account](https://app.netbird.io/)
- Admin access to office network infrastructure
- A server or VM at the office to serve as the routing peer

## Step 1: Deploy a Routing Peer at the Office

Choose an always-on server at your office. This can be:
- A dedicated Linux VM
- A Windows Server
- A Docker container on an existing server

**Install NetBird:**

```bash
# Linux
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.ps1" -OutFile "install.ps1"; .\install.ps1
```

**Connect using a setup key:**

1. In the NetBird dashboard, go to **Setup Keys**
2. Create a reusable key for server deployments
3. Run: `netbird up --setup-key YOUR_SETUP_KEY`

## Step 2: Create a Network for Office Resources

1. Go to **Networks** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Network** and name it "Office LAN"
3. Click **Add Resource** and enter your office subnet (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`)
4. Assign it to a group like "office-resources"

## Step 3: Add the Routing Peer

1. In the Office LAN network, click **Add Routing Peer**
2. Select your office server
3. Click **Add Routing Peer**

## Step 4: Create Access Policies

1. Go to **Access Control > Policies**
2. Create a policy:
   - Name: "Remote Worker Office Access"
   - Source: "Remote Workers" group (or appropriate user group)
   - Destination: "office-resources"
   - Protocol: Choose based on needs (TCP for most apps, All for full access)

## Step 5: Onboard Remote Workers

Distribute NetBird to remote workers:

1. Create setup keys for employee devices
2. Have employees install NetBird and connect
3. Add employees to the "Remote Workers" group

Employees can now access office resources from any location.

## Best Practices for Business Deployments

### Access Control

- Create specific groups for different access levels (IT Admin, Sales, Engineering)
- Use protocol restrictions (e.g., only allow RDP to certain servers)
- Implement time-limited setup keys for contractor access

### High Availability

For critical connections, consider:
- Multiple routing peers at each location
- Monitoring routing peer health
- Automatic failover configuration

### Security

- Enable [Posture Checks](/manage/access-control/posture-checks) to verify device compliance
- Use [Activity Logging](/manage/activity) to audit access
- Implement MFA through your identity provider

## Troubleshooting

**Remote workers can't access office resources:**
1. Verify the routing peer is online and connected
2. Check access policies include the user's group
3. Ensure the routing peer can reach office resources locally

**Slow performance:**
1. Check routing peer placement—it should have good network connectivity
2. Consider enabling [lazy connections](/manage/peers/lazy-connection) for large deployments
3. Review network route priorities if multiple routes exist

## Next Steps

- **Need Site-to-VPN or Site-to-Site?** If office systems need to initiate connections to remote workers, or you need to connect branch offices, see [Network Routes Use Cases](/manage/network-routes/use-cases)
- **Advanced configuration:** See [Advanced Configuration](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/advanced-configuration) for masquerade options and detailed access control
