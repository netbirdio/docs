# Provision Users and Groups From Microsoft Entra ID via API

[Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id),
formerly known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a cloud-based identity and access management service that provides
organizations with secure authentication, single sign-on, and user management capabilities. In the context of network security,
it can be effectively used to control network access based on organizational structure, such as groups and individual user accounts.

NetBird's Microsoft Entra ID integration allows you to synchronize users and groups from Entra ID to NetBird.
You can then use these synchronized groups to configure your network, create network access policies, and automate
onboarding and offboarding processes.

## Get Started with NetBird-Entra ID Integration

To get started, navigate to [Integrations](https://app.netbird.io/integrations) in the left menu, which will take you to the
`Identity Provider` integration. Click the `Entra ID (Azure AD)` button. This action will trigger a pop-up window that will
present you with a user-friendly wizard, guiding you through the synchronization process between NetBird and Azure AD.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration process, verify that you have the required permissions in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
Specifically, you will need an Azure user account with at least one of these roles:

* Application Administrator
* Cloud Application Administrator
* Global Administrator

To check your permissions:

* Log in to the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com).
* Navigate to Manage Microsoft Entra ID and click `View`.
* Expand the `Manage` tab and click on `Roles and administrators` in the left menu.
* Look for your username and verify if you're assigned any of the above roles.

![EntraID Roles](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/lDyaAeV.png)

If you don't have the required permissions, contact your Azure AD administrator to grant you the appropriate role before proceeding with the NetBird integration.

## Create and Configure a Microsoft Entra ID Application for NetBird Integration

Now that you have the required permissions, return to the NetBird dashboard. Click on the `Get Started` button to initiate the integration process.

A new wizard screen will appear, offering step-by-step instructions for creating and configuring your Microsoft Entra ID application. To simplify the process, the wizard also provides quick-copy buttons for essential information:

* Name
* Account Type
* Redirect Type
* Redirect URI

![NetBird Create Application](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/oI0Pjai.png)

For convenience, click on [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview) (step 1). That will open the Azure dashboard. Navigate to `App registrations` in the left menu and then click `+New registration` as indicated below:

![EntraID App Registration](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/Yxxktk6.png)

Fill in the required information:

![EntraID Register an App](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/1t8qbfK.png)

After entering all required information, click the `Register` button at the bottom of the form to finalize the application registration process.

Upon successful registration, you'll be redirected to a confirmation screen similar to the following:

On the next screen, click on the `Application permissions` button, which will let you select the appropriate permissions for NetBird to function correctly with your Microsoft Entra ID environment.

![EntraID Request API Permissions](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/zSkSGAm.png)

To assign user permissions:

* Locate the search bar at the top. Type `User.Read.All` into the search bar and press `Enter`.
* In the search results, click on the `User` tab to expand it and view the available permissions.
* Click on the checkbox to select and enable the `User.Read.All` permission.

![EntraID UserReadAll](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/KHGbhqe.png)

The `User.Read.All` permission allows NetBird to read the full set of profile properties, group memberships, and reports of the signed-in user and other users in your organization.

Next, repeat the procedure. This time, search for `Group.Read.All` and click on the checkbox to enable it as shown below:

![EntraID GroupReadAll](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/XDl3b7u.png)

Once done, click the `Add permissions` button. You will see a few warnings:

![NetBird Users Sync](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/microsoft-entra-id-sync/bpwW1Bn.png)

After configuring user and group synchronization, the setup wizard will finalize the process and you'll automatically return to the main Identity Provider screen.

On this screen, you'll see two key indicators of successful integration:

* The Microsoft Entra ID toggle will be switched on (enabled).
* Next to the toggle, you'll see a button with a status message saying `Synced a few seconds ago`.

These indicators confirm that:

* The integration between NetBird and Microsoft Entra ID is active.
* The initial synchronization has been completed successfully.
* NetBird will now automatically sync with your Microsoft Entra ID at regular intervals.

<Note>
    You can manually trigger a sync or adjust settings by clicking on the Microsoft Entra ID section in the Identity Provider screen
