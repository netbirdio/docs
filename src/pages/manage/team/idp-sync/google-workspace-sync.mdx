# Provision Users and Groups From Google Workspace

[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) provides a comprehensive suite of cloud-based productivity tools that enhance team collaboration and
communication. Notably, its [identity management](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/identity/overview-google-authentication) features streamline user authentication and access control,
ensuring efficiency and security across your organization.

NetBird's Google Workspace integration enhances user management capabilities by synchronizing users and groups from
Google Workspace to NetBird. You can utilize these synchronized groups to configure your network, establish network
access policies, and automate onboarding and offboarding processes, adding significant value to your organizational
workflow and security posture.

The integration process involves two complementary services: Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Google Workspace serves as your Identity Provider (IdP), managing user and group identities and providing Single Sign-On (SSO)
capabilities. GCP is used to create a service account, which NetBird uses to authenticate and access Google Workspace
data via the Admin SDK API. This service account uses OAuth 2.0 for secure, authorized access to Workspace information.

## Get Started with NetBird-Google Workspace Integration

Go to the `Integrations` section in the left menu to access the `Identity Provider integration`. Click the `Google Workspace` button. This will open a pop-up window featuring an intuitive wizard to guide you through the synchronization process between NetBird and Google Workspace.

</p>

## Prerequisites

The NetBird-Google Workspace integration process involves:

* Creating a project on the Google Cloud Platform.
* Setting up a service account within that GCP project.
* Creating a secret key for the service account.
* Creating a new role in Google Workspace for the service account.
* Granting the service account the appropriate role in Google Workspace.

You’ll need a Google Workspace user account with sufficient permissions to create and manage user and group access. User roles that have these permissions include:

* Super Admin
* Groups Admin
* User Management Admin

To [check your user permissions](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7519580?hl=en) within Google Workspace:

* Sign in to your Google Admin console
* Navigate to `Directory` > `Users`.
* Select your user account and click on `Admin roles and privileges` to view assigned roles and permissions.

Confirm that you have one of the required roles before proceeding with the integration:

<p>
  <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/google-workspace-sync/Ky8bguM.png"
    alt="Google Workspaces User Permissions" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

If you lack the required permissions, please contact your workspace administrator to request them.

Because Google Cloud automatically provision new organizations with [Secure by Default enforcements](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/secure-by-default-organizations), you’ll also need a GCP user account with enough permissions to create service account keys. User roles that have these permissions include:

* Organization Administrator
* Organization Policy Administrator

To [check your organization-level permissions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-org) within Google Cloud:

* Sign in to [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
* In the top bar, click on the dropdown. Find and select your organization in the list.
* Once you've selected the organization, go to `IAM & Admin` > `IAM` in the left sidebar. This will show you a list of all users (principals) and service accounts with roles at the organization level.
* Look for users with roles like `Organization Administrator`, `Organization Policy Administrator`, or other high-level roles.

> NOTE: Verifying your GCP permissions is mandatory before proceeding with the integration since you might need to disable the `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` constraint temporarily during the process.

    alt="Google Workspace IAM & Admin" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

If you lack the required role, contact your organization's IT department or the person who set up your Google Cloud account.

## Creating the NetBird Project

Once you have the necessary permissions, you can create the NetBird project in GCP.
