# Provision Users and Groups From Microsoft Entra ID via SCIM

[Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id),
formerly known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a cloud-based identity and access management service that provides
organizations with secure authentication, single sign-on, and user management capabilities. In the context of network security,
it can be effectively used to control network access based on organizational structure, such as groups and individual user accounts.

NetBird's Microsoft Entra ID SCIM integration allows you to synchronize users and groups from Entra ID to NetBird.
You can then use these synchronized groups to configure your network, create network access policies, and automate
onboarding and offboarding processes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the integration process, ensure you have the necessary admin permissions in Microsoft Entra ID. You need an Azure user account with at least one of these roles:

* Application Administrator
* Cloud Application Administrator
* Global Administrator

## Enabling Microsoft Entra ID SCIM in NetBird

To enable SCIM synchronization in NetBird, navigate to `Integrations > Identity Provider Sync` in your NetBird dashboard.

![Microsoft Entra ID Configure Attribute Mapping](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/entra-id-scim-sync/entra-configure-attribute-mapping.png)

After creating the provisioning configuration, you need to configure the attribute mapping to ensure the `externalId` is mapped to the user's `objectId`.

Navigate to the `Attribute mapping` section and click `Provision Microsoft Entra ID Users`.

![Microsoft Entra ID Default Attribute Mapping](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/entra-id-scim-sync/entra-default-attribute-mapping.png)

In the attribute mappings list, locate the `externalId` row and click `Edit`.

Change the **Source attribute** from `mailNickname` to `objectId`.

![Microsoft Entra ID Provisioning Started](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/entra-id-scim-sync/entra-provisioning-started.png)

Once started, Microsoft Entra ID will automatically synchronize the assigned users and groups to NetBird.

Click `Finish Setup` in the NetBird Dashboard to finalize the integration process.

## Verify Synchronization

After starting provisioning, the synchronization will begin automatically. You can verify that users and groups
have been successfully synchronized by navigating to `Team > Users` in your NetBird dashboard.

<Note>
    SCIM provisioning will manage only resources that are created through Microsoft Entra ID. Any resources created directly in NetBird will not be managed by SCIM.
</Note>

<Note>
    Synced groups will only be available for membership and will not change the role of user in NetBird
</Note>

## Configuration Settings

You can access some configuration settings inside the NetBird Dashboard. E.g. if you want to regenerate the authentication token or want to filter users and groups based on a specific prefix.
Simply go to the Integrations page and click the settings icon of your integration.

![Microsoft Entra ID SCIM Configuration Options](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/entra-id-scim-sync/entra-configuration-options.png)

### Regenerate Auth Token

If your authentication token has expired or you need to update it, click **Regenerate Auth Token** in the configuration window to generate a new token.

![Microsoft Entra ID Regenerate Authentication Token](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/entra-id-scim-sync/entra-regenerate-auth-token.png)


### Groups to be synchronized

By default, all groups assigned to the NetBird application in Entra will be synchronized. If you want to synchronize only assigned groups that start with a specific prefix, you can specify them in the filter. Keep in mind that the prefix matching is case-sensitive.

![Microsoft Entra ID Group Prefix Filter](/docs-static/img/manage/team/idp-sync/entra-id-scim-sync/entra-group-prefix.png)

Click `Continue` to proceed to the next step.

### Users to be synchronized

By default, all users from the groups assigned to the NetBird application in Entra will be synchronized. If you want to further filter and synchronize only users from specific assigned groups, you can specify those group names in the filter. The group name matching is case-sensitive.
