# Keycloak on NetBird Cloud 

You can use Keycloak as your Identity Provider with NetBird, but it will require some additional configuration steps. Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It's one of the most popular self-hosted IDP solutions with extensive documentation and community support. Keycloak provides single sign-on, social login, user federation, fine-grained authorization, and supports OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0 protocols.

1. You need to create a new client

    - Browse to the clients Administration menu and then click in Create client:

</p>

2. Create a client with the type OpenID Connect and add any client ID and name for the client:

</p>

</p>

4. Click Next and fill the following fields:

    Valid redirect URIs: `https://login.netbird.io/login/callback` <br/>
    Web origins: `+`

<p>

</p>

5. Click Save.

6. Next we need to retrieve the secret for the client, you can get that in the Credentials tab for the client:

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/team/single-sign-on/keycloak-idp/5-new-client-credentials.png" alt="new-client" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

7. Then, share the following information with the NetBird support team at support@netbird.io:

- Client ID
- Keycloak URL
- Realm
- Client Secret
- Email domains for your users

<Note>
We recommend using a secure channel to share the Client’s secret. You can send a separate email and use a secret sharing service like: <br/>

https://password.link/en
