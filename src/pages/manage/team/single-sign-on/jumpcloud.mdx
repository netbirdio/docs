# JumpCloud on NetBird Cloud 

You can use JumpCloud as your Identity Provider with NetBird, but it will require some additional configuration steps. JumpCloud is a cloud-based directory platform that provides identity, access, and device management in a unified solution. It offers single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, directory services, device management, and network access control, providing a comprehensive approach to managing users, devices, and applications from a single platform.

1. Access the JumpCloud and navigate to USER AUTHENTICATION > SSO Applications

2. Click + Add New Application, select Custom Application and click Next

3. Enable Manage Single Sign-On (SSO), select Configure SSO with OIDC and click Next
