# Network Routes

Network Routes allow you to route traffic from NetBird peers to private networks without installing the NetBird agent on every device. A routing peer forwards packets between your NetBird mesh network and your internal networks (LANs, VPCs, data centers).

## When to Use Network Routes

Network Routes support all remote access scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **VPN-to-Site** | NetBird peers access devices on remote networks |
| **Site-to-VPN** | Clientless devices initiate connections to NetBird peers |
| **Site-to-Site** | Two networks communicate through NetBird, with neither endpoint running NetBird |

<Note>
For VPN-to-Site only, you can also use [Networks](/manage/networks), which offers a simpler setup experience. Network Routes is required for Site-to-VPN and Site-to-Site scenarios.
</Note>

## Key Concepts

### Routing Peer
A device running NetBird that forwards traffic between the NetBird network and a private network. The routing peer must have network access to the resources you want to reach.

### Masquerade
When enabled (default), the routing peer performs NAT on forwarded traffic, hiding the original source IP. This simplifies setup by eliminating the need for return routes on the remote network.

### Distribution Groups
Specify which peers receive the network route configuration. Peers in the distribution groups will automatically have the route available.

### ACL Groups
Provide granular access control for routes. When assigned, only peers with policies granting access to the ACL Group can use the route.

### High Availability
Deploy multiple routing peers for the same route to provide failover. NetBird clients will automatically select the best available peer based on metrics and connection quality.

## Networks vs Network Routes

| Capability | Networks | Network Routes |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| VPN-to-Site | Yes | Yes |
| Site-to-VPN | No | Yes |
| Site-to-Site | No | Yes |
| Setup complexity | Simpler | More configuration |
| Access control | Per-resource policies | Per-route with ACL Groups |
| Masquerade control | Always on | Configurable |

**Use Networks when:**
- You only need VPN-to-Site access
- You prefer a guided setup experience

**Use Network Routes when:**
- You need Site-to-VPN or Site-to-Site connectivity
- You need to disable masquerade for source IP preservation
- You need ACL Groups for route-level access control
