# Network Routes Use Cases

These guides show how to use [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes) for Site-to-Site and Site-to-VPN connectivity—scenarios where clientless devices need to communicate across networks.

## Understanding the Scenarios

### Site-to-Site

Two networks communicate with each other, with neither end-device running NetBird directly. Each network has a routing peer that handles traffic.

```
Home NAS ──► Routing Peer ──► NetBird Tunnel ──► Routing Peer ──► Office Server
(no NetBird)    (peer)                              (peer)         (no NetBird)
```

**Example scenarios:**
- Connect branch offices to headquarters
- Link home networks of family members
- Bridge on-premise data centers with cloud VPCs

### Site-to-VPN

A device without NetBird initiates connections to NetBird peers. This is the reverse of VPN-to-Site.

```
Office Server ──────► Routing Peer ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Your Laptop
 (no NetBird)           (peer)                                      (peer)
```

**Example scenarios:**
- Monitoring systems pushing data to remote analysts
- On-premise servers initiating backups to cloud peers
- Legacy systems that must initiate outbound connections

<Note>
For VPN-to-Site (NetBird peers accessing clientless devices), you can use either [Networks](/manage/networks/use-cases) (recommended for simplicity) or Network Routes.
</Note>

## Why Use Network Routes?

Network Routes is required when you need:
- **Site-to-Site connectivity** - Connect two networks together
- **Site-to-VPN connectivity** - Clientless devices initiating connections
- **Masquerade control** - Preserve source IPs for auditing
- **ACL Groups** - Route-level access control

/>

## Key Configuration Steps

All Site-to-Site and Site-to-VPN scenarios follow this pattern:

1. **Deploy routing peers** at each site
2. **Create network routes** for each site's subnet
3. **Create access policies** allowing routing peers to communicate
4. **Configure clientless devices** to route traffic through the local routing peer

For detailed configuration guidance, see [Advanced Configuration](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/advanced-configuration).
