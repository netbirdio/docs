# Resolving Overlapping Routes

NetBird [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes) enable peers to access external networks such as VPCs, LANs, or office networks. When multiple networks have overlapping IP ranges, NetBird's route selection feature lets you choose which routes to apply on the client side.

<Note>
    Route selection requires NetBird client version 0.27.4 or later.
</Note>

## Using Route Selection

You can select routes through the CLI or the system tray GUI.

### CLI

List available routes:

```bash
netbird routes list
```

Example output:

```
Available Routes:

  - ID: aws-vpc-ireland
    Network: 172.17.0.0/16
    Status: Selected

  - ID: aws-vpc-ohio
    Network: 172.17.0.0/16
    Status: Selected
```

In this example, both routes have the same network range and are both selected, causing a conflict. To resolve this, select only one route:

```bash
netbird routes select aws-vpc-ireland
```

<Note>
    Running `netbird routes select` deselects all other routes by default.
</Note>

Additional examples:

```bash
# Select all routes
netbird routes select all

# Select multiple routes
netbird routes select route1 route2

# Append a route without deselecting others
netbird routes select -a route3
```

### GUI

Open the NetBird system tray application and navigate to **Network Routes**. Click the checkbox next to each route to select or deselect it.

### Enabling All Routes

Use `netbird routes select all` in the CLI or the corresponding button in the GUI to select all available routes, including any added in the future. This restores the default behavior.

### Disabling All Routes

Use `netbird routes deselect all` in the CLI or the GUI button to deselect all routes, including any added in the future.
