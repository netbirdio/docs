# Site-to-Site: Home Networks

This guide shows how to connect two home networks together so devices can communicate across locations—without installing NetBird on every device.

## What You'll Achieve

After following this guide, devices on one home network can communicate with devices on another home network. For example:
- Your home NAS can back up to your parents' NAS
- Family members can access shared media servers
- IoT devices can communicate across homes

```
Home A: NAS ──► Routing Peer ──► NetBird Tunnel ──► Routing Peer ──► Parents' NAS
        (no NetBird)  (peer)                           (peer)        (no NetBird)
```

<Note>
Site-to-Site requires Network Routes because the Networks feature doesn't yet support bidirectional routing between sites.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- A [NetBird cloud account](https://app.netbird.io/) or [self-hosted instance](/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart)
- An always-on device at each home to serve as routing peers (Raspberry Pi, NAS with Docker, etc.)
- Different subnets at each location (if both use `192.168.1.0/24`, see [Resolve Overlapping Routes](/manage/network-routes/use-cases/by-configuration/overlapping-routes))

## Example Scenario

- **Your home**: `192.168.1.0/24` with routing peer "home-rpi"
- **Parents' home**: `192.168.2.0/24` with routing peer "parents-rpi"

## Step 1: Create Setup Keys with Groups

Before installing NetBird on your routing peers, create setup keys with auto-assigned groups:

1. Go to **Setup Keys** in the NetBird dashboard
2. Click **Create Setup Key**
3. For your home routing peer:
   - Network Identifier: "Home Routing Peer"
   - Auto-assigned groups: Create and add `home-routing-peers`
   - Click **Create**
4. Repeat for parents' home:
   - Network Identifier: "Parents Routing Peer"
   - Auto-assigned groups: Create and add `parents-routing-peers`

<Note>
You can also add groups to peers manually after setup. Go to **Peers**, select the peer, and add groups under **Assigned Groups**.
</Note>

## Step 2: Install NetBird on Routing Peers

**At your home:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh
sudo netbird up --setup-key YOUR_HOME_SETUP_KEY
```

**At parents' home:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh
sudo netbird up --setup-key YOUR_PARENTS_SETUP_KEY
```

## Step 3: Create Network Routes

1. Go to **Network Routes** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Route**

**For your home network:**
- Network range: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Routing Peer: Select "home-rpi" (or use "home-routing-peers" Peer Group)
- Distribution Groups: "parents-routing-peers"
- Access Control Groups: "home-routing-peers" (optional—for route-level policies, this group becomes the destination in access policies; without it, policies targeting this route won't apply)
- Network Identifier: `home-lan`
- Enable **Masquerade** in Additional Settings (recommended for simplicity)
- Click **Add Route**

</p>

**For parents' home network:**
- Network range: `192.168.2.0/24`
- Routing Peer: Select "parents-rpi" (or use "parents-routing-peers" Peer Group)
- Distribution Groups: "home-routing-peers"
- Access Control Groups: "parents-routing-peers" (optional—for route-level policies, this group becomes the destination in access policies; without it, policies targeting this route won't apply)
- Network Identifier: `parents-lan`
- Enable **Masquerade** in Additional Settings (recommended)
- Click **Add Route**

</p>

## Step 4: Create Access Policies

Create two policies that allow the routing peers to communicate in both directions:

1. Go to **Access Control > Policies**
2. Add first policy:
   - Network Identifier: "Home to Parents"
   - Source: "home-routing-peers"
   - Destination: "parents-routing-peers"
   - Protocol: All (or restrict as needed)

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/network-routes/by-scenario/site-to-site-home/add-policy-home-to-parents.png" alt="Create policy for home to parents" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

3. Add second policy:
   - Network Identifier: "Parents to Home"
   - Source: "parents-routing-peers"
   - Destination: "home-routing-peers"
   - Protocol: All (or restrict as needed)

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/network-routes/by-scenario/site-to-site-home/add-policy-parents-to-home.png" alt="Create policy for parents to home" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

## Step 5: Configure Clientless Devices

For devices without NetBird to reach the other network, add a static route pointing to the local routing peer.

**On a Linux device at your home:**

```bash
# Route to parents' network through your routing peer
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.100
```

Where `192.168.1.100` is your routing peer's local IP.

**On a Windows device:**

```powershell
route add 192.168.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.100
```

<Note>
For persistent routes, configure them in your router's DHCP settings or the device's network configuration.
</Note>

**Router-level configuration (recommended):**

Configure your router to advertise routes via DHCP or add a static route that applies to all devices:

```
# On your home router
Destination: 192.168.2.0/24
Gateway: 192.168.1.100 (your routing peer's IP)
```

## Step 6: Test Cross-Network Access

From a device at your home:

```bash
ping 192.168.2.1  # Parents' router
ping 192.168.2.50 # Parents' NAS
```

From a device at parents' home:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.1  # Your router
ping 192.168.1.50 # Your NAS
```

## Troubleshooting

**Site-to-site not working:**
1. Verify both routing peers are online and connected: check `netbird status` on each
2. Check that static routes are configured on clientless devices
3. Ensure access policies allow traffic in both directions

**Can't reach specific devices:**
1. Verify the device has a route to the remote network
2. Check firewall rules on the target device
3. Ensure the routing peer can reach the target on its local network

**Traffic works one way but not the other:**
1. Check that both network routes exist
2. Verify access policies exist for both directions
3. Ensure static routes are configured at both ends
