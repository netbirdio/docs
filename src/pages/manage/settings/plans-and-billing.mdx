## Usage-based Billing

NetBird uses a pay-as-you-go model, charging only for active users or machines.
We bill you at the end of each monthly cycle based on actual usage:
* A user or machine counts as "active" only if it connects or logs in (including the admin dashboard) at least once during the billing period.
* If you integrate NetBird with your [Identity Provider (IdP)](/manage/team/idp-sync),
we automatically sync your users and machines. Inactive synced user accounts that never connect or log in won't incur charges.

Example:
You sync 300 users from Entra ID, but only 100 connect during the month. You're billed for 100 users, not 300.
If the next month only 70 connect, you pay for 70 users.

Refer to our pricing calculator on the [pricing page](https://netbird.io/pricing#calculator) to estimate your monthly costs based on your expected usage.

## Machine-based Usage

NetBird offers scalable plans for networks with a machine-based usage model. This approach is relevant, among other scenarios,
for IoT use cases where there is a large number of machines on the network but comparatively fewer users.
This option is available under both Team and Business plans. Simply subscribe to the Team or Business plan, and we'll
automatically adjust the machine costs as detailed in the following sections.


### Inclusive Machine Allowance
- **Team and Business plans**: Start with 100 free machines and an extra 10 machines for each paid user.
- **Example**: a Team plan with 10 users provides:
- `(10 users × 10 machines/user) + 100 base machines = 200 machines`

### Additional Machine Billing
- Extra machines are billed at a set rate per machine.
- **Example**: Adding 20 extra machines to a Team plan with 10 users:
- Base plan cost: `(10 users × €5/user) = €50`
- Extra machines cost: `(20 extra machines × €0.5/machine) = €10`
- **Total monthly cost**: `€50 + €10 = €60`

## Changing a Subscription

Based on your current plan, you have the flexibility to upgrade or downgrade at any time as your needs change. 

<Note>
Your subscription cycle starts on the first day of your original subscription. If you adjust your plan during the billing cycle, and since billing occurs at the end of the subscription month, you will be charged for the plan you are on at the end of the billing cycle.
