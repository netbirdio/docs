# Site-to-Site Connectivity

Site-to-site connectivity allows you to connect entire networks together, enabling devices to communicate across locations without installing the NetBird client on every device.

## Understanding Remote Access Scenarios

NetBird supports three distinct remote access scenarios. Understanding which one you need is the first step to a successful setup.

### VPN-to-Site

A NetBird peer (device running the NetBird client) accesses devices on a remote network that don't have NetBird installed.

```
Your Laptop ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Routing Peer ──────► Office Printer
  (peer)                                    (peer)              (clientless)
```

**Common use cases:**
- Access your home NAS from anywhere
- Reach office servers while traveling
- Connect to IoT devices on a remote network

**Implementation:** Use [Networks](/manage/networks) (recommended) or [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/routing-traffic-to-private-networks)

### Site-to-VPN

A device without NetBird initiates connections to NetBird peers. This is the reverse of VPN-to-Site—the clientless device starts the connection.

```
Office Server ──────► Routing Peer ──────► NetBird Tunnel ──────► Your Laptop
 (clientless)           (peer)                                      (peer)
```

**Common use cases:**
- Office monitoring systems pushing data to remote analysts
- On-premise servers initiating backups to cloud peers
- Legacy systems that must initiate outbound connections

**Implementation:** Requires [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/routing-traffic-to-private-networks) (Networks does not currently support this)

### Site-to-Site

Devices on separate networks communicate with each other, with neither running NetBird directly. Each network has a routing peer that handles traffic.

```
Home NAS ──► Routing Peer ──► NetBird Tunnel ──► Routing Peer ──► Office Server
(clientless)    (peer)                              (peer)         (clientless)
```

**Common use cases:**
- Connect branch office networks to headquarters
- Link home networks of family members
- Bridge on-premise data centers with cloud VPCs

**Implementation:** Requires [Network Routes](/manage/network-routes/routing-traffic-to-private-networks) (Networks does not currently support this)

<Note>
The Networks feature currently supports VPN-to-Site only. For Site-to-VPN and Site-to-Site scenarios, use Network Routes. Networks support for these scenarios may be added in future releases.

## Which Scenario Do I Need?

| I want to... | Scenario | Feature to Use |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Access home devices from my laptop | VPN-to-Site | Networks or Network Routes |
| Access office resources while traveling | VPN-to-Site | Networks or Network Routes |
| Let an office server connect to my laptop | Site-to-VPN | Network Routes only |
| Connect two home networks together | Site-to-Site | Network Routes only |
| Link branch offices | Site-to-Site | Network Routes only |
| Bridge cloud VPC with on-premise network | Site-to-Site | Network Routes only |

## How It Works

All scenarios use a routing peer—a device running NetBird that forwards traffic for its local network:

1. **Deploy a routing peer** at each site (any device running NetBird with access to the local network)
2. **Configure routing** to advertise each site's subnet through NetBird
3. **Set access policies** to control which peers can reach which networks
4. **Configure clientless devices** to route traffic through the routing peer (for Site-to-VPN and Site-to-Site)

## Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Routing peer | A device running NetBird that forwards traffic for its local network |
| Clientless device | A device that doesn't run NetBird (printers, IoT, legacy systems) |
| Network Routes | Legacy feature for routing traffic to private networks (supports all scenarios) |
| Networks | Newer feature for defining network resources (VPN-to-Site only) |
| Masquerade | NAT that hides source IPs behind the routing peer's IP (simplifies setup) |

## Quick Reference: Networks vs Network Routes

| Capability | Networks | Network Routes |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| VPN-to-Site | Yes | Yes |
| Site-to-VPN | No | Yes |
| Site-to-Site | No | Yes |
| Setup complexity | Simpler | More configuration required |
| Access control | Per-resource policies | Per-route with ACL Groups |
