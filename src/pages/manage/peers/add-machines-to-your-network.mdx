# Add peers to your NetBird network

Whether you have a network for personal use or manage your company's corporate network, you'd probably want to add machines
(or peers in NetBird's terms) to your network.

NetBird peer is a machine that runs the [NetBird agent](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works#client-application)
and is connected to the network. NetBird peer can be a virtual machine running in the cloud like AWS or Google Cloud,
an Android or iOS device, a personal laptop, a single-board computer like Raspberry Pi, a docker container, or even a router.
