# Approve peers
The peer approval feature enhances network security by requiring manual administrator approval before a device can join the NetBird network.
This feature is handy when network administrators want to ensure access is restricted only to trusted, corporate-managed devices.

When enabled, devices connect to the management service without network access to other resources.
Administrators then can assess whether the peer is eligible to join the network.

<Note>
    This feature is only available in the [NetBird cloud](https://app.netbird.io/) version.

## Automate peer approval with EDR integrations
NetBird integrates with popular EDR solutions like [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) to automate peer approval
and allow only trusted devices to join the network.
Check the [EDR integrations](/manage/access-control/endpoint-detection-and-response) guide for more information on how to enable this feature.
