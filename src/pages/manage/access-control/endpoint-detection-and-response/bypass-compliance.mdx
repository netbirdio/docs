# Bypass Compliance for Non-Compliant Peers

In some situations, you may need to grant network access to a peer that fails EDR or MDM compliance checks. NetBird provides a **compliance bypass** mechanism that allows administrators to override compliance rejections on a per-peer basis.

## When to Use Compliance Bypass

Compliance bypass is useful in scenarios such as:

- **Temporary exceptions**: A device needs immediate network access while compliance issues are being resolved.
- **Testing and development**: Test devices that may not have EDR agents installed.
- **Legacy devices**: Older devices that cannot run the required EDR agent but still need limited network access.
- **False positives**: When the EDR platform incorrectly flags a compliant device.

<Note>
    Compliance bypass should be used sparingly and only when necessary. It bypasses security controls designed to protect your network.
</Note>

## How Compliance Bypass Works

When you bypass compliance for a peer:

1. The peer immediately gains network access, regardless of its compliance status.
2. The bypass remains active until:
   - An administrator manually revokes it, OR
   - The device becomes naturally compliant in the EDR system (bypass is automatically removed)
3. All bypass actions are logged in the [Activity Events](/manage/activity-events) for audit purposes.

## Bypass Compliance for a Peer

To bypass compliance for a non-compliant peer:

1. Navigate to the [Peers](https://app.netbird.io/peers) page in the NetBird dashboard
2. Locate the peer showing `Non-compliant` status (red badge)
3. Hover over the **Bypass** button to see which integration's compliance check will be bypassed
4. Click the **Bypass** button and confirm the action in the dialog

</p>

The peer will immediately gain network access and the non-compliant status will be replaced with a green `Bypassed` badge.

## View Bypassed Peers

To see all peers that have compliance bypassed:

1. Navigate to the [Peers](https://app.netbird.io/peers) page
2. Click the **Bypassed** filter button (shows a count badge with the number of bypassed peers)

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/access-control/endpoint-detection-and-response/bypass-compliance/bypassed-filter.png" alt="Bypassed filter button" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

The filter can be combined with connection status filters:
- Click **Online** + **Bypassed** to see only online bypassed peers
- Click **Offline** + **Bypassed** to see only offline bypassed peers

Hovering over the filter buttons shows helpful tooltips:
- **Non-Compliant**: "Peers that failed compliance checks and need attention"
- **Bypassed**: "Peers with compliance checks bypassed by an administrator"

## Revoke Compliance Bypass

To revoke a bypass and return a peer to normal compliance validation:

1. Navigate to the [Peers](https://app.netbird.io/peers) page
2. Click on the peer with bypassed compliance
3. Click the **Revoke** button next to the "Bypassed" badge
4. Confirm the action

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/access-control/endpoint-detection-and-response/bypass-compliance/revoke-bypass.png" alt="Revoke compliance bypass" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

Once revoked, the peer will be subject to normal compliance checks. If the device is still non-compliant, it will lose network access and show the `Non-compliant` status again.

## Batch Operations

You can bypass compliance or revoke bypass for multiple peers at once:

### Batch Bypass

1. Navigate to the [Peers](https://app.netbird.io/peers) page
2. Select multiple peers using the checkboxes (peers must have non-compliant status)
3. In the action bar that appears at the bottom, click the **Bypass Compliance** button (shield icon)
4. Confirm the action in the dialog

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/access-control/endpoint-detection-and-response/bypass-compliance/batch-bypass.png" alt="Batch bypass" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

The button shows a count of how many selected peers will have compliance bypassed.

### Batch Revoke Bypass

1. Navigate to the [Peers](https://app.netbird.io/peers) page
2. Select multiple bypassed peers using the checkboxes
3. In the action bar that appears at the bottom, click the **Revoke Compliance Bypass** button (shield-off icon)
4. Confirm the action in the dialog

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/manage/access-control/endpoint-detection-and-response/bypass-compliance/batch-revoke-bypass.png" alt="Batch revoke bypass" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

<Note>
    Batch operation buttons only appear when you have an EDR integration enabled and have selected peers that can have compliance bypassed or revoked.
</Note>

## Automatic Removal of Bypass

Compliance bypass is automatically removed when a device becomes naturally compliant in your EDR platform. This ensures that:

- Devices don't retain unnecessary administrative overrides
- Your security posture improves as devices become compliant
- You don't need to manually clean up bypasses

For example, if you bypass compliance for a peer because its EDR agent was temporarily offline, the bypass will be automatically removed once the agent reconnects and the device passes compliance checks.

## Activity Logging

All compliance bypass actions are recorded in the activity log:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Peer compliance bypassed by admin` | An administrator bypassed compliance for a peer |
| `Peer compliance bypass revoked` | An administrator or the system removed the bypass |

You can view these events in the [Activity Events](/manage/activity-events) page, including details about which administrator performed the action and the original rejection reason.

## API Access

Compliance bypass can also be managed via the NetBird API:

```bash
# Bypass compliance for a peer
curl -X POST "https://api.netbird.io/api/peers/{peer-id}/edr/bypass" \
  -H "Authorization: Token <your-api-token>"

# Revoke compliance bypass
curl -X DELETE "https://api.netbird.io/api/peers/{peer-id}/edr/bypass" \
  -H "Authorization: Token <your-api-token>"

# List all bypassed peers
curl -X GET "https://api.netbird.io/api/peers/edr/bypassed" \
  -H "Authorization: Token <your-api-token>"
```

## Best Practices

- **Document exceptions**: Keep a record of why each compliance bypass was granted.
- **Review regularly**: Periodically review bypassed peers and revoke bypasses that are no longer needed.
- **Use time-limited access**: Consider revoking bypasses after a defined period.
- **Monitor activity**: Watch for unusual patterns in bypass usage.
- **Prefer compliance**: Always aim to bring devices into compliance rather than relying on bypasses.

<Note>
    Compliance bypass requires the `EDR Update` permission. Only users with appropriate roles can bypass compliance or revoke bypasses.
