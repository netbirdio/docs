# Install NetBird

If you're a new user you should visit the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/getting-started). This will help you setup your management dashboard and connect your first client. For quick install instructions, including desktop applications, visit the [install prompt](https://app.netbird.io/install) through the management dashboard. To view all the client installation methods we've set up a variety of platform specific pages.

The NetBird client (agent) allows a peer to join a pre-existing NetBird deployment. If a NetBird deployment is not yet available, there are both managed and [self-hosted](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart) options available.

## Running NetBird with a Setup Key
In case you are activating a server peer, you can use a [setup key](/manage/peers/setup-keys) as described in the steps below.
> This is especially helpful when you are running multiple server instances with infrastructure-as-code tools like ansible and terraform.

1. Login to the Management Service. You need to have a `setup key` in hand (see [setup keys](/manage/peers/setup-keys)).

For all systems:
```bash
  netbird up --setup-key <SETUP KEY>
```

For **Docker**, you can run with the following command:
```bash
docker run --network host --privileged --rm -d -e NB_SETUP_KEY=<SETUP KEY> -v netbird-client:/var/lib/netbird netbirdio/netbird:<TAG>
```
> TAG > 0.6.0 version

Alternatively, if you are hosting your own Management Service provide `--management-url` property pointing to your Management Service:
```bash
  netbird up --setup-key <SETUP KEY> --management-url http://localhost:33073
```

> You could also omit the `--setup-key` property. In this case, the tool will prompt for the key.

2. Check connection status:
```bash
  netbird status
```

3. Check your IP:

On **macOS** :
````bash
  sudo ifconfig utun100
````
On **Linux**:
```bash
  ip addr show wt0
     ```
On **Windows**:
```bash
  netsh interface ip show config name="wt0"
```
