# Self-hosted vs. Cloud-hosted NetBird

NetBird can be used in two ways: self-hosted and cloud-hosted (SaaS). The self-hosted version is a standalone version
that can be installed on your own servers while the cloud-hosted version is a SaaS (Software as a Service) that is hosted
on our servers.

Often times, the question arises: what is the difference between the two? This post gives a short overview of the
differences between the two versions.

## Before Choosing to Self-Host NetBird in Production

When we first created NetBird, our goal was to simplify network administration — freeing admins from the headaches of
configuring firewalls, opening ports, managing VPN gateways, handling certificates, and so on. We wanted to provide a
tool that lets teams completely close off their network from the outside world, while still enabling devices to seamlessly
discover and connect to internal resources just by installing the client apps. However, as is often the case with easy-to-use tools,
a lot happens behind the scenes. NetBird relies on a range of interconnected components that work together to ensure secure
peer-to-peer connectivity, fallback relayed connections through a network of geographically distributed relay servers,
and overall system reliability and availability. It is not an easy task to deploy and maintain such infrastructure in
a reliable manner. NetBird is not just one VPN server. You can read more about how NetBird works [here](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works).

## What's New: No External IdP Required

Starting with version 0.62, self-hosting NetBird has become significantly easier. Previously, self-hosting required setting up and maintaining a separate identity provider (like Zitadel, Keycloak, or Auth0). Now, the Management service supports **local user management** directly, which means:

- **No external IdP required** - Create and manage users directly in NetBird
- **Fewer containers** to deploy and maintain (4-5 vs 7+ previously)
- **Lower resource requirements** (~1GB RAM vs 2-4GB previously)
- **User management directly in the Dashboard**
- **Optional external IdPs** - Connect Google, Microsoft, Okta, etc. if you want SSO
- **Multiple IdPs supported** - Configure multiple OIDC providers simultaneously

This makes self-hosting a more viable option for homelabs, small teams, and proof-of-concept deployments.

## Installation and Maintenance

NetBird platform is a combination of [multiple components](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works) that make it possible for
machines to establish direct point-to-point connections and for network administrators to manage the network,
e.g., control network access.

When running the self-hosted version, you are responsible for installing and maintaining all the components as well as backing up
and securing the data. With local user management built into the Management service, this burden is significantly reduced—you no longer need to maintain separate identity provider infrastructure.

The cloud-hosted NetBird only requires you to install the client software (NetBird agent) on your machines and log them in to the network.
The cloud-hosted version is more suitable for organizations that want a hassle-free solution that is easy to set up and maintain.

## Features

While the self-hosted and cloud-hosted versions share the same core connectivity features, the cloud-hosted version has
some additional features that are targeted at business customers and help with network automation and management. These features include:

- **[Users and groups provisioning](/manage/team/idp-sync)** from your identity provider (IdP).
- **[Traffic events logging](/manage/activity/traffic-events-logging)** of connections to internal resources for audit and analysis.
- **[Event streaming](/manage/activity/event-streaming)** to 3rd party platforms and SIEM systems.
- **[Integrations with EDR](/manage/access-control/endpoint-detection-and-response)** like CrowdStrike and others.
- **[Peer approval](/manage/peers/approve-peers)** to join the network.
- **[User invites](/manage/team/add-users-to-your-network#direct-user-invites)**.
- **[MSP functionality](/manage/for-partners/msp-portal)** for managing multiple tenant networks from a single account.

<Note>
SCIM provisioning and some enterprise features require a [Commercial License](https://netbird.io/pricing#on-prem) for self-hosted deployments.

## Geo Distributed Relay Servers

NetBird uses relay servers to establish connections between machines when a direct point-to-point connections isn't possible.

When using the cloud-hosted version, you benefit from the geo-distributed relay server clusters that are located in multiple regions
around the world ensuring that your machines can always establish a connection. The NetBird agents pick the closest relay server.

When using the self-hosted version, you need to set up your own relay servers. This a complex task and requires additional
maintenance effort.

## Highly Available Management Layer

When using the cloud-hosted version, you benefit from highly available control plane servers (Management) providing stability for
your critical network infrastructure.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Self-Hosted | Cloud-Hosted |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Setup time** | ~5 minutes with local users | Instant |
| **Infrastructure** | You manage | We manage |
| **Identity provider** | Built-in local users (+ optional external IdPs) | Managed |
| **Multiple IdPs** | Yes, OIDC-compatible | Yes |
| **Relay servers** | Single instance (or DIY geo-distribution) | Geo-distributed globally |
| **High availability** | DIY | Included |
| **SCIM provisioning** | Enterprise license | Included (Business+) |
| **Cost** | Your infrastructure costs | Subscription |
| **Best for** | Homelabs, air-gapped networks, compliance requirements | Teams wanting hassle-free setup |
