# Monitor system and network activity

The activity monitoring feature lets you quickly see what's happening with your network.
Whether a new machine or user joined your network or the access control policy has been modified, the activity log allows you to track the changes to your network.

Activity monitoring is enabled by default for every network, and you can access it in the web UI under the [Activity tab](https://app.netbird.io/activity).
You can also use the search bar to filter events by activity type.

<Note>
    The current version of NetBird tracks network changes that occur in the Management server. E.g., changes related to the list of peers, groups, system settings, setup keys, access control, etc.
    The future versions will support connection events that occur in NetBird agents (e.g., peer A connected to peer B).
