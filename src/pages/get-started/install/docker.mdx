# Docker Installation

The NetBird client (agent) allows a peer to join a pre-existing NetBird deployment. If a NetBird deployment is not yet available, there are both managed and [self-hosted](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart) options available.

## Docker Run Command

Set the ```NB_SETUP_KEY``` environment variable and run the command.

<Note>
    You can pass other settings as environment variables. See [Environment variables](/get-started/cli#environment-variables) for details.
</Note>

NetBird makes use of eBPF and raw sockets, therefore to guarantee the client software functionality, we recommend adding the flags `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` and `--cap-add=SYS_RESOURCE` for docker clients.
The experience may vary depending on the docker daemon, operating system, or kernel version.

```bash
docker run --rm --name PEER_NAME --hostname PEER_NAME --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_RESOURCE -d -e NB_SETUP_KEY=<SETUP KEY> -v netbird-client:/var/lib/netbird netbirdio/netbird:latest
```

See [Docker example](/use-cases/examples#net-bird-client-in-docker) for details.

### Troubleshooting
1. If you are using self-hosted version and haven't specified `--management-url`, the client app will use the default URL
which is ```https://api.wiretrustee.com:33073```.

2. If you have specified a wrong `--management-url` (e.g., just by mistake when self-hosting)
to override it you can do the following:

```bash
netbird down
netbird up --management-url https://<CORRECT HOST:PORT>/
```

To override it see the solution #1 above.

## Docker Compose
If you prefer to run NetBird as a Docker compose stack below is an example. Configure to your specific needs.
```yaml
services:
  netbird:
      container_name: netbird
      hostname: <HOSTNAME>
      cap_add:
          - NET_ADMIN
          - SYS_ADMIN
          - SYS_RESOURCE
      network_mode: host
      environment:
          - NB_SETUP_KEY=<SETUP KEY>
      volumes:
          - netbird-client:/var/lib/netbird
      image: netbirdio/netbird:latest
volumes:
  netbird-client:
      name: netbird-client
```

## Running NetBird with a Setup Key
In case you are activating a server peer, you can use a [setup key](/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys) as described in the steps below.
> This is especially helpful when you are running multiple server instances with infrastructure-as-code tools like ansible and terraform.

1. Login to the Management Service. You need to have a `setup key` in hand (see [setup keys](/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys)).

```bash
docker run --network host --privileged --rm -d -e NB_SETUP_KEY=<SETUP KEY> -v netbird-client:/var/lib/netbird netbirdio/netbird:<TAG>
```
> TAG > 0.6.0 version

> You could also omit the `--setup-key` property. In this case, the tool will prompt for the key.

2. Check connection status:
```bash
  netbird status
```

3. Check your IP:

````bash
  sudo ifconfig utun100
````
