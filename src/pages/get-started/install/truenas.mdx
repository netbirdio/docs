# Install NetBird on TrueNAS

NetBird can now be installed on TrueNAS via [TrueNAS Apps](https://apps.truenas.com/catalog/netbird-client/) (the built-in app catalog). 

<Note>
The NetBird app on TrueNAS runs in a Docker container. You **cannot** use the peer's NetBird IP address or [NetBird domain (hostname)](/manage/dns/index) to connect directly to your TrueNAS instance traffic to those addresses reaches the container, not the TrueNAS host. See [Access TrueNAS via NetBird Networks](#access-truenas-via-netbird-networks) below for the full steps.
</Note>

## Install NetBird from Catalog

1. In TrueNAS, go to **Apps** and search for **NetBird**. If it doesn't appear, refresh the catalog (e.g., **Discover Apps** or the catalog refresh option in your TrueNAS version).

2. Click **Install** and configure the app as described below. Most defaults are fine; the main fields you need to set are **Hostname** and **Setup Key**.

3. After installation, confirm the app is **Running** in the Apps list.
4. Open your [NetBird dashboard](https://app.netbird.io/) and go to **Peers**. You should see your TrueNAS peer listed. Rename it (e.g., "TrueNAS" or "NAS") if you like for easier identification.

### App configuration

When you install the NetBird app, TrueNAS shows an **Edit Netbird Client** form. Use this as a guide:

**Netbird Client Configuration**

- **Application name**: Display name in TrueNAS (e.g., "NetBird" or "Netbird Client"). Default is fine.
- **Timezone**: Leave default unless you need a specific timezone for logs.
- **Hostname**: Name this peer will use in NetBird (e.g., "truenas" or "nas"). Pick something you’ll recognize in the dashboard.
- **Setup Key** *(required)*: Paste the setup key you created in [Generate your Setup Key](#generate-your-setup-key). This registers the TrueNAS peer with your NetBird network.
- **Userspace**: Leave default (userspace networking). Only change if you have a specific need.
- **Management URL** *(optional)*: Leave empty for NetBird Cloud (`https://api.netbird.io`). Set this only if you use a [self-hosted](/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart) management server.
- **Additional Environment Variables**: Leave empty unless you need extra [environment variables](/get-started/cli#environment-variables).

**Network Configuration**

- **Host Network**: Enable **Host Network** so the NetBird container uses the TrueNAS host's network stack. Without it, the container only has its own network and cannot reach your LAN or act as a [routing peer](/manage/networks/homelab/access-home-network#choose-or-add-a-routing-peer-in-your-lan). Turn this on unless you have a specific reason to keep the peer isolated (e.g. you only need the peer in the mesh with no LAN access).

**Storage Configuration**

- **State Storage**: Use the default (e.g., **ixVolume**) so NetBird can persist its state. This keeps the peer identity and config across app restarts.

**Resources Configuration**

- **CPUs** and **Memory (MB)**: Defaults are usually sufficient. Increase if you have many peers or heavy routing.

You can leave **Labels** and **Additional Storage** empty unless you use them for access policies or custom storage.

## Access TrueNAS via NetBird Networks

Because NetBird on TrueNAS runs inside a Docker container, you cannot connect directly to the TrueNAS host or its services by IP as you would to a normal peer. To reach TrueNAS or other devices on the same LAN, use [NetBird Networks](/manage/networks/homelab/access-home-network):

1. **Create a NetBird Network**: In the dashboard, go to **Networks** → **Add Network**. Name it (e.g., "Home LAN" or "TrueNAS LAN").
2. **Add the TrueNAS peer as a routing peer**: In that network, click **Add Routing Peer** and select the TrueNAS peer. This makes TrueNAS the gateway for traffic into your local subnet.
3. **Add a network resource**: Click **Add Resource**. Either:
   - Add your **entire LAN subnet** (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) so you can reach TrueNAS and any other device on that subnet, or
   - Add a **single resource** (e.g., `192.168.1.100/32`) if you only need access to the TrueNAS host.

After you define an [access control policy](/manage/networks/homelab/access-home-network#create-an-access-control-policy) that allows the right peers or groups to reach this network, you can access TrueNAS and other resources on that subnet through the TrueNAS routing peer.
