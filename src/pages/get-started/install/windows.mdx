# Windows Installation

The NetBird client (agent) allows a peer to join a pre-existing NetBird deployment. If a NetBird deployment is not yet available, there are both managed and [self-hosted](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart) options available.

1. Download the latest Windows release:
    - <Button href="https://pkgs.netbird.io/windows/x64" variant="text">EXE Installer</Button><br />
    - <Button href="https://pkgs.netbird.io/windows/msi/x64" variant="text">MSI Installer</Button><br />
2. Execute the installer and proceed with the installation steps
3. This will install the UI client in the `C:\Program Files\NetBird` and add the daemon service
4. After installing, you can follow the steps from [Running NetBird with SSO Login](#running-net-bird-with-sso-login).
<Note>
    To uninstall the client and service, you can use Add/Remove programs
</Note>

Check connection status:
```bash
  netbird status
```

## Running NetBird with a Setup Key
In case you are activating a server peer, you can use a [setup key](/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys) as described in the steps below.
> This is especially helpful when you are running multiple server instances with infrastructure-as-code tools like ansible and terraform.

1. Login to the Management Service. You need to have a `setup key` in hand (see [setup keys](/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys)).

For all systems:
```bash
netbird up --setup-key <SETUP KEY>
```

Alternatively, if you are hosting your own Management Service provide `--management-url` property pointing to your Management Service:
```bash
  netbird up --setup-key <SETUP KEY> --management-url http://localhost:33073
```

> You could also omit the `--setup-key` property. In this case, the tool will prompt for the key.

2. Check connection status:
```bash
netbird status
```

3. Check your IP:

```bash
netsh interface ip show config name="wt0"
```
