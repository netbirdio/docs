# MacOS Installation

The NetBird client (agent) allows a peer to join a pre-existing NetBird deployment. If a NetBird deployment is not yet available, there are both managed and [self-hosted](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart) options available.

## Install with one command

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh
```

### Package install

1. Download the latest MacOS release installer for your [processor](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814 ):
    - Intel: <Button href="https://pkgs.netbird.io/macos/amd64" variant="text" arrow="right">Download NetBird for Intel</Button>
    - M1 & M2: <Button href="https://pkgs.netbird.io/macos/arm64" variant="text" arrow="right">Download NetBird for Apple Silicon</Button><br />
_If you require an older version checkout NetBird [releases](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest)_
2. Proceed with the installation steps
3. This will install the NetBird app into /Applications and add the daemon service
4. After installing, you can follow the steps from [Running NetBird with SSO Login](#Running-NetBird-with-SSO-Login) steps.
> To uninstall the client remove the app from /Applications

### Homebrew install

1. Download and install homebrew at https://brew.sh/
2. If netbird was previously installed with homebrew, you will need to run:
```bash
# Stop and uninstall daemon service:
sudo netbird service stop
sudo netbird service uninstall
# unlink the app
brew unlink netbird
```
> netbird will copy any existing configuration from the netbird's default configuration paths to the new NetBird's default location

3. Install the client
```bash
  # for CLI only
  brew install netbirdio/tap/netbird
  # for GUI package
  brew install --cask netbirdio/tap/netbird-ui
```
4. If you installed CLI only, you need to install and start the client daemon service:
 ```bash
  sudo netbird service install
  sudo netbird service start
```

### Binary Install
**Installation from binary (CLI only)**

1. Checkout NetBird [releases](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest)
2. Download the latest release:
```bash
  curl -L -o ./netbird_<VERSION>.tar.gz https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/download/v<VERSION>/netbird_<VERSION>_<OS>_<Arch>.tar.gz
```

<Note>

    You need to replace some variables from the URL above:

    - Replace **VERSION** with the latest released version.
    - Replace **OS** with "linux", "darwin" for MacOS or "windows"
    - Replace **Arch** with your target system CPU architecture

</Note>

3. Decompress
```bash
  tar xzf ./netbird_<VERSION>.tar.gz
  sudo mv netbird /usr/bin/netbird
  sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/netbird
  sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/netbird
```
After that you may need to add /usr/bin in your PATH environment variable:
````bash
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin
````
4. Install and run the service
```bash
  sudo netbird service install
  sudo netbird service start
```

</p>

### CLI
Alternatively, you could use command line. Simply run
   ```bash
  netbird up
   ```
> It will open your browser, and you will be prompt for email and password. Follow the instructions.

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/get-started/netbird-sso-login-cmd.gif" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

Check connection status:
```bash
  netbird status
```

### Running NetBird with a Setup Key
In case you are activating a server peer, you can use a [setup key](/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys) as described in the steps below.
> This is especially helpful when you are running multiple server instances with infrastructure-as-code tools like ansible and terraform.

1. Login to the Management Service. You need to have a `setup key` in hand (see [setup keys](/manage/peers/register-machines-using-setup-keys)).

```bash
  netbird up --setup-key <SETUP KEY>
```

Alternatively, if you are hosting your own Management Service provide `--management-url` property pointing to your Management Service:
```bash
  netbird up --setup-key <SETUP KEY> --management-url http://localhost:33073
```

> You could also omit the `--setup-key` property. In this case, the tool will prompt for the key.

2. Check connection status:
```bash
  netbird status
```

3. Check your IP:

````bash
  sudo ifconfig utun100
````
