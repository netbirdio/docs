# NetBird Agent command line interface (CLI)

The NetBird client installation adds a binary called `netbird` to your system. This binary runs as a daemon service to connect
your computer or server to the NetBirt network as a peer. But it can also be used as a client to control the daemon service.

This section will explore the commands available in `netbird`.
## Syntax
Use the following syntax to run `netbird` commands from your terminal window:
```shell
netbird [command] [subcommand] [flags]
```
* `command`: Specifies the operation that you want to perform or a top-level command: `up`, `login`, `down`, `status`, `ssh`, `version`, and `service`
* `subcommand`: Specifies the operation to be executed for a top-level command like `service`: `install`, `uninstall`, `start`, and `stop`
* `flags`:  Specifies optional flags. For example, you can use the `--setup-key` flag to specify the setup key to be used in the commands `login` and `up`

<Note>
    To see detailed command information, use the flag `--help` after each command
</Note>

## Configuration precedence

This is the CLI configuration precedence (highest to lowest priority):

1. environment variables (eg: `NB_WIREGUARD_PORT`)
2. command line flags (eg: `--wireguard-port`)
3. configuration file entries `<profile>.json` (formerly: `config.json`), eg: `WgPort` key

We are preserving the unusual priority of environment variables for backwards compatibility with existing deployments.

## Global flags
`netbird` has a set of global flags that are available in every command. They specify settings that are core or shared between two or more commands, e.g. `--setup-key` is used by `login` and `up` to authenticate the client against a management service.

Below is the list of global flags:
```shell
      --admin-url string        Admin Panel URL [http|https]://[host]:[port] (default "https://app.netbird.io")
  -A, --anonymize               anonymize IP addresses and non-netbird.io domains in logs and status output
      --daemon-addr string      Daemon service address to serve CLI requests [unix|tcp]://[path|host:port] (default "unix:///var/run/netbird.sock")
      --log-file string         sets NetBird log path. If console is specified the the log will be output to stdout (default "/var/log/netbird/client.log")
  -l, --log-level string        sets NetBird log level (default "info")
  -m, --management-url string   Management Service URL [http|https]://[host]:[port] (default "https://api.wiretrustee.com:443")
  -p, --preshared-key string    Sets Wireguard PreSharedKey property. If set, then only peers that have the same key can communicate.
  -k, --setup-key string        Setup key obtained from the Management Service Dashboard (used to register peer)

```
### Environment Variables
Every flag of a `netbird` command can be passed as an environment variable. We are using the following rule for the environment variables composition:
* `PREFIX_FLAGNAME` and for flags with multiple parts: `PREFIX_FLAGNAMEPART1_FLAGNAMEPART2`
* The prefix is always **NB**
* The flag parts are separated by a dash ("-") when passing as flags and with an underscore ("_") when passing as an environment variable

For example, let's check how we can pass `--config` and `--management-url` as environment variables:
```shell
export NB_CONFIG="/opt/netbird/config.json"
export NB_MANAGEMENT_URL="https://api.self-hosted.com:33073"
netbird up
```
The `up` command would process the variables, read the configuration file on `/opt/netbird/config.json` and attempt to connect to the management service running at `https://api.self-hosted.com:33073`.

Here are some additional examples of environment variables:
```shell
# Disable profiles feature
export NB_DISABLE_PROFILES=true

# Disable update settings functionality
export NB_DISABLE_UPDATE_SETTINGS=true

# Set custom log level
export NB_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Set custom daemon address
export NB_DAEMON_ADDR="tcp://localhost:8080"
```

## Commands
### up
Single command to log in and start the NetBird client. It can send a signal to the daemon service or run in the foreground with the flag `--foreground-mode`.

The command will check if the peer is logged in and connect to the management service. If the peer is not logged in, by default, it will attempt to initiate an SSO login flow.
#### Flags
```shell
      
      --allow-server-ssh                      Allow SSH server on peer. If enabled, the SSH server will be permitted
      --disable-auto-connect                  Disables auto-connect feature. If enabled, then the client won't connect automatically when the service starts.
      --disable-ssh-auth                      Disable SSH JWT authentication. If enabled, any peer with network access can connect without user authentication
      --dns-resolver-address string           Sets a custom address for NetBird's local DNS resolver. If set, the agent won't attempt to discover the best ip and port to listen on. An empty string "" clears the previous configuration. E.g. --dns-resolver-address 127.0.0.1:5053 or --dns-resolver-address ""
      --ssh-jwt-cache-ttl int                 SSH JWT token cache TTL in seconds. Set to 0 to disable caching (default). E.g. --ssh-jwt-cache-ttl 3600 for 1-hour cache
      --enable-rosenpass                      [Experimental] Enable Rosenpass feature. If enabled, the connection will be post-quantum secured via Rosenpass.
      --enable-ssh-local-port-forwarding      Enable local port forwarding on SSH server. Requires --allow-server-ssh
      --enable-ssh-remote-port-forwarding     Enable remote port forwarding on SSH server. Requires --allow-server-ssh
      --enable-ssh-root                       Enable root user login on SSH server. Requires --allow-server-ssh
      --enable-ssh-sftp                       Enable SFTP subsystem on SSH server. Requires --allow-server-ssh
      --external-ip-map strings               Sets external IPs maps between local addresses and interfaces.You can specify a comma-separated list with a single IP and IP/IP or IP/Interface Name. An empty string "" clears the previous configuration. E.g. --external-ip-map 12.34.56.78/10.0.0.1 or --external-ip-map 12.34.56.200,12.34.56.78/10.0.0.1,12.34.56.80/eth1 or --external-ip-map ""
      --extra-dns-labels strings              Sets DNS labels. You can specify a comma-separated list of up to 32 labels. An empty string "" clears the previous configuration. E.g. --extra-dns-labels vpc1 or --extra-dns-labels vpc1,mgmt1 or --extra-dns-labels ""
  -F, --foreground-mode                       start service in foreground
  -h, --help                                  help for up
      --interface-name string                 Wireguard interface name (default "utun100")
      --rosenpass-permissive                  [Experimental] Enable Rosenpass in permissive mode to allow this peer to accept WireGuard connections without requiring Rosenpass functionality from peers that do not have Rosenpass enabled.
      --wireguard-port uint16                 Wireguard interface listening port (default 51820)
```
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
netbird up
```
If you are running on a self-hosted environment, you can pass your management url by running the following:
```shell
netbird up --management-url https://api.self-hosted.com:33073
```
if you want to run in the foreground, you can use "console" as the value for `--log-file` and run the command with sudo:
```shell
sudo netbird up --log-file console
```
<Note>
    On Windows, you may need to run the command from an elevated terminal session.
</Note>
In case you need to use a setup key, use the `--setup-key` flag :
```shell
netbird up --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD
```
You can set extra DNS labels with the `--extra-dns-labels` flag:
```shell
netbird up --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD --extra-dns-labels vpc1,mgmt1 
```
<Note>
    This feature requires a setup-key with permissions to add peers with the extra labels.
</Note>
Multiple peers with the same extra labels will generate grouped DNS labels on the client side, and this feature can be used for DNS round-robing load balancing.

### login
Command to authenticate the NetBird client to a management service. If the peer is not logged in, by default, it will attempt to initiate an SSO login flow.
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
netbird login
```
If you are running on a self-hosted environment, you can pass your management url by running the following:
```shell
netbird login --management-url https://api.self-hosted.com:33073
```
In case you need to use a setup key, use the `--setup-key` flag:
```shell
netbird login --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD
```
Passing a management url and a setup key:
```shell
netbird login --setup-key AAAA-BBB-CCC-DDDDDD --management-url https://api.self-hosted.com:33073
```

### down
Command to stop a connection with the management service and other peers in a NetBird network. After running this command, the daemon service will enter an `Idle` state.
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
netbird down
```

### status
Retrieves the peer status from the daemon service.

</Note>

### ssh
Command to connect via SSH to a remote peer in your NetBird network. The `ssh` command has several subcommands for different operations.

<Note>
    Before using this command, make sure that SSH Access is enabled both on the target peer and in the NetBird Dashboard. Learn more about [enabling SSH access](/manage/peers/ssh).
</Note>

#### ssh (connect)
Connect to a remote peer via SSH with an interactive shell or execute a command.

**Flags:**
```shell
  -L, --local-forward string    Local port forwarding (e.g., 8080:localhost:80)
  -R, --remote-forward string   Remote port forwarding (e.g., 8080:localhost:3000)
  -p, --port int                Remote SSH port (default: 22)
```

**Arguments:**
* `user@host`: The remote user and NetBird peer IP address
* `[command]`: Optional command to execute on the remote peer

**Usage:**

Interactive shell:
```shell
netbird ssh user@100.119.230.104
```

Execute a single command:
```shell
netbird ssh user@100.119.230.104 "uptime"
```

Local port forwarding (forward local port 8080 to remote port 80):
```shell
netbird ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@100.119.230.104
```

Remote port forwarding (forward remote port 8080 to local port 3000):
```shell
netbird ssh -R 8080:localhost:3000 user@100.119.230.104
```

<Note>
Port forwarding must be enabled on the SSH server using `--enable-ssh-local-port-forwarding` and/or `--enable-ssh-remote-port-forwarding` flags.
</Note>

<Note>
For SFTP and SCP, use native clients (`sftp` and `scp` commands) which work with NetBird SSH automatically.
</Note>

#### Troubleshooting

**Connection fails:**

- Ensure SSH is enabled on the target peer:
  ```shell
  netbird up --allow-server-ssh
  ```
- Verify SSH Access is enabled in the dashboard (Peers > your_peer > SSH Access)
- Check that an ACL policy allows TCP port 22022

**Authentication fails:**

- Complete the OIDC flow when prompted (browser window will open)
- Verify your IdP is properly configured
- To disable JWT authentication: `netbird up --allow-server-ssh --disable-ssh-auth`

**Port forwarding not working:**

- Ensure the server has the appropriate flags:
  ```shell
  netbird up --allow-server-ssh \
    --enable-ssh-local-port-forwarding \
    --enable-ssh-remote-port-forwarding
  ```

### version
Outputs the `netbird` command version.
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
netbird version
```
This will output:
```shell
0.8.2
```

### service
The service command is a top-level command with subcommands to perform operations related to the daemon service.

You should run the service command with elevated permissions.

### service install
The install installs the daemon service on the system.
#### Usage
The minimal form of running the command is:
```shell
sudo netbird service install
```
You can use the global flags to configure the daemon service. For instance, you can set a debug log level with the flag `--log-level`
```shell
sudo netbird service install --log-level debug
```
You can set a custom configuration path with the flag `--config`
```shell
sudo netbird service install --config /opt/netbird/config.json
```

#### Service-specific flags
```shell
      --disable-profiles          Disables profiles feature. If enabled, the client will not be able to change or edit any profile. To persist this setting, use: netbird service install --disable-profiles
      --disable-update-settings   Disables update settings feature. If enabled, the client will not be able to change or edit any settings. To persist this setting, use: netbird service install --disable-update-settings

```

<Note>
    The `--disable-profiles` flag can also be set using the `NB_DISABLE_PROFILES` environment variable. Set it to any value (e.g., `true`, `1`, `yes`) to enable this feature.
    
    The `--disable-update-settings` flag can also be set using the `NB_DISABLE_UPDATE_SETTINGS` environment variable. Set it to any value (e.g., `true`, `1`, `yes`) to enable this feature.
</Note>

### service uninstall

#### Examples
Run debugging for 5 minutes and generate an anonymized debug bundle:
```shell
netbird debug for 5m
```

This will output something similar to:
```
Netbird up
Log level set to trace.
Netbird down
Netbird up
Remaining time: 00:00:01
Duration completed
Creating debug bundle...
Netbird down
Log level restored to INFO
/tmp/netbird.debug.3162242909.zip
```

#### Flags
```shell
  -h, --help        help for for
  -A, --anonymize   anonymize IP addresses and non-netbird.io domains in the debug output
  -S, --system-info Adds system information to the debug bundle
```


### debug log
This subcommand manages the logging level for the NetBird daemon during the current session.
The change in logging level is temporary and will revert back to the configured default upon daemon restart.

#### Usage
Adjust the logging level of the NetBird daemon:
```shell
netbird debug log level <level>
```

#### Available Levels
- `panic`: for panic level, the highest level of severity.
- `fatal`: for fatal level errors that cause the program to exit.
- `error`: for error conditions.
- `warn`: for warning conditions.
- `info`: for informational messages.
- `debug`: for debug-level messages.
- `trace`: for trace-level messages, which include more fine-grained information than debug.

#### Examples
Set the logging level to debug:
```shell
netbird debug log level debug
```

This will output:
```
Log level set successfully to debug
```
