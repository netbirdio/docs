# Introduction to NetBird

<YouTube videoId="CFa7SY4Up9k" />

NetBird is an Open Source Zero Trust Networking platform that allows you to create secure private networks for your
organization or home. We designed NetBird to be simple and fast, requiring near-zero configuration effort and leaving
behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, etc.

<Note>
    NetBird is an **[open-source](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird)** project and can be self-hosted.
    See a comparison between the self-hosted and cloud-hosted versions [here](/selfhosted/self-hosted-vs-cloud-netbird).
</Note>

There is no centralized VPN server with NetBird - your computers, devices, machines, and servers connect to each other directly over a fast encrypted tunnel.
It creates a high-performance point-to-point [WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/) overlay network that connects machines running anywhere in just a few clicks.

It literally takes less than 5 minutes to deploy a secure point-to-point VPN with NetBird.
