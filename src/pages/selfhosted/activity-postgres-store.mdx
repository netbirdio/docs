# Activity Events Postgresql store

## Using Postgres for fresh installations

The default configuration for fresh installations is SQLite storage. However users have the option to leverage the benefits
of Postgres for new instances beginning from version `0.46.0`.

To enable Postgres add to your management service the following environmental variable:
```bash
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE=postgres
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN=host=localhost port=5432 user=<user> password=<password> dbname=<db_name>
```

You can switch back to sqlite storage by setting the `NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE` variable to `sqlite`.
<Note>
    Switching between storage options requires migration steps to prevent data loss.

## Migrating from SQLite store to Postgres store
This migration process allows users to seamlessly transition between storage options while maintaining data integrity.

<Note>
    The following commands assume you use the latest docker version with the compose plugin. If you have docker-compose installed as a standalone, please use docker-compose as a command.
</Note>

1. Backup your data store (`events.db` in `datadir` - default `/var/lib/netbird/`)
```bash
mkdir backup
docker compose cp -a management:/var/lib/netbird/. backup/
```

2. Import Sqlite data to Postgres

For migrating the Sqlite data we rely on the [pgloader](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader) tool. You can install it by running
`sudo apt-get install pgloader` on debian or `brew install pgloader` on MacOS.

```bash
pgloader --type sqlite backup/events.db "postgresql://<PG_USER>:<PG_PASSWORD>@<PG_HOST>:<PG_PORT>/<PG_DB_NAME>"
```

3. Create `.env` file with the following content:
```bash
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE=postgres
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN="host=<PG_HOST> user=<PG_USER> password=<PG_PASSWORD> dbname=<PG_DB_NAME> port=<PG_PORT>"
```

4. Update `docker-compose.yml` file to  pass the postgres configuration to the `management` container
```yaml
environment:
  - NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE=${NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE}
  - NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN=${NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN}
env_file:
  - .env
```

5. Restart the management service
```bash
docker compose restart management
```

6. Check logs to confirm the store switch:
```bash
docker compose logs management
```
You should see an entry similar to:
```
2025-06-06T18:23:17+03:00 INFO [context: SYSTEM] management/server/activity/store/sql_store.go:260: using postgres as activity event store engine
```

## Rollback to Sqlite store
To rollback to the Sqlite  store, follow these steps:
<Note>
    The following commands assume you use the latest docker version with the compose plugin. If you have docker-compose installed as a standalone, please use docker-compose as a command.
</Note>

1. Restore `events.db` backup
```bash
docker compose cp backup/events.db management:/var/lib/netbird/events.db
```

2. Enable SQLite by setting the `NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE` environment variable to `sqlite`:
```bash
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE=sqlite
```

3. Restart the Management service.
```bash
docker compose restart management
```

4. Check logs to confirm the store switch:
```bash
docker compose logs management
```

You should see an entry similar to:
```
2025-06-06T18:24:19+03:00 INFO [context: SYSTEM] management/server/activity/store/sql_store.go:260: using sqlite as activity event store engine
```
