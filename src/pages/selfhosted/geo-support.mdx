# Management Geolocation

NetBird's management system traditionally relies on Geolocation databases. From version 0.26.0, we've introduced initial
support for posture checks. By default, NetBird uses the GeoLite2 City database from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com)
to determine a peer's geographical location, based on its IP address.

<Note>
Even though we distribute the databases, MaxMind owns them. Please, refer to MaxMind's website for [license agreement](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/eula) details.

This guideline describes the steps required to setup Management with GeoLite2 database:

## Downloading the databases

At NetBird's startup, our management checks if the GeoLite2 databases exist in its data directory. If not present, the
databases will be downloaded from the following URLs:

- GeoLite2 City Database: [Download Link](https://pkgs.netbird.io/geolocation-dbs/GeoLite2-City/download?suffix=tar.gz)
- GeoLite2 City Database (SHA256): [Download Link](https://pkgs.netbird.io/geolocation-dbs/GeoLite2-City/download?suffix=tar.gz.sha256)
- GeoLite2 City CSV Database: [Download Link](https://pkgs.netbird.io/geolocation-dbs/GeoLite2-City-CSV/download?suffix=zip)
- GeoLite2 City CSV Database (SHA256): [Download Link](https://pkgs.netbird.io/geolocation-dbs/GeoLite2-City-CSV/download?suffix=zip.sha256)

Upon downloading, the management system sets up the databases as needed. If the databases are already present,
the existing databases will be loaded and used.

## Upgrading the GeoLite2 Database

The GeoLite2 databases are updated twice a week to keep track of changing geolocation data. It's crucial to keep your
local GeoLite2 databases updated. You can achieve this manually through our provided script.

Below are the steps to upgrade the GeoLite2 databases:

### Step 1. Switch to the infrastructure files directory:
```bash
cd netbird/infrastructure_files/
```

### Step 2. Run the script to download the GeoLite2 databases:
```bash
./download-geolite2.sh
```
After successfully running the script, two database files (`geonames.db` and `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`) are created in the
`netbird/infrastructure_files/` directory.

### Step 3. The next step involves moving these files into our management service container.

Move the `geonames.db` database:
```bash
docker-compose cp geonames.db management:/var/lib/netbird/
```

Move the `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` database:
```bash
docker-compose cp GeoLite2-City.mmdb management:/var/lib/netbird/
```

4. The final step is to restart the management service to ensure it loads the updated databases:

```bash
docker-compose restart management
```
This completes the upgrade process. Your GeoLite2 databases are now up-to-date.
By following the guide above, your GeoLite2 databases should always be updated with the latest geolocation data.
