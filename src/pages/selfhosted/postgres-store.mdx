# Management Postgresql store

## Using Postgres for fresh installations

As of version 0.26.0, the default configuration for fresh installations is SQLite storage.
However, users have the option to leverage the benefits of Postgres for new instances beginning from version `0.27.8`.
To enable Postgres, add to your `setup.env` the following variable:
```bash
NETBIRD_STORE_CONFIG_ENGINE=postgres
```
This will result in a configuration similar to the following in your `management.json` file:
```json
    "StoreConfig": {
        "Engine": "postgres"
    }
```
You can switch back to sqlite storage by setting the `NETBIRD_STORE_CONFIG_ENGINE` variable to `sqlite`.
<Note>
    Switching between storage options requires migration steps to prevent data loss.
</Note>


## Migrating from SQLite store to Postgres store
This migration process allows users to seamlessly transition between storage options while maintaining data integrity.

<Note>
    The following commands assume you use the latest docker version with the compose plugin. If you have docker-compose installed as a standalone, please use docker-compose as a command.
</Note>

1. Backup your data store (`store.db` in `datadir` - default `/var/lib/netbird/`)
```bash
mkdir backup
docker compose cp -a management:/var/lib/netbird/. backup/
```

2. Import Sqlite data to Postgres

For migrating the Sqlite data we rely on the [pgloader](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader) tool. You can install it by running
`sudo apt-get install pgloader` on debian or `brew install pgloader` on MacOS.

```bash
pgloader --type sqlite backup/store.db "postgresql://<PG_USER>:<PG_PASSWORD>@<PG_HOST>:<PG_PORT>/<PG_DB_NAME>"
```

3. Resolve any compatibility issues that may arise due to the migration process.

<Note>
As of version 0.26.0, NetBird used SQLite as its default database store. However, SQLite lacked support for cascading deletions,
which means that related entries were not automatically removed when their parent entries were deleted.
 With the migration to PostgreSQL, foreign key constraints are enforced, including cascading deletes, to ensure referential integrity.
</Note>

To address this, you can execute the following SQL commands in your PostgreSQL database:

```sql
DELETE FROM policy_rules WHERE policy_rules.policy_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM policies);
```

```sql
DELETE FROM routes WHERE routes.account_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM accounts);
```

```sql
DELETE FROM name_server_groups WHERE name_server_groups.account_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM accounts);
```

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rules;
```

4. Enable Postgres by updating the `management.json` file and setting the `Engine` field to `postgres` as the following example:
```json
"StoreConfig": {
    "Engine": "postgres"
}
```

5. Create `.env` file with the following content:
```bash
NETBIRD_STORE_ENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN="host=<PG_HOST> user=<PG_USER> password=<PG_PASSWORD> dbname=<PG_DB_NAME> port=<PG_PORT>"
```

6. Update `docker-compose.yml` file to  pass the postgres configuration to the `management` container
```yaml
environment:
  - NETBIRD_STORE_ENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN=${NETBIRD_STORE_ENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN}
env_file:
  - .env
```

7. Restart the management service
```bash
docker compose restart management
```

8. Check logs to confirm the store switch:
```bash
docker compose logs management
```
You should see an entry similar to:
```
2024-05-10T15:09:34Z INFO management/server/store.go:109: using Postgres store engine
```

## Rollback to Sqlite store
To rollback to the Sqlite  store, follow these steps:
<Note>
    The following commands assume you use the latest docker version with the compose plugin. If you have docker-compose installed as a standalone, please use docker-compose as a command.
</Note>

1. Restore `store.db` backup
```bash
docker compose cp backup/. management:/var/lib/netbird/
```

2. Enable SQLite by updating the `management.json` file and setting the `Engine` field to `sqlite` as the following example:
```json
"StoreConfig": {
    "Engine": "sqlite"
}
```

3. Restart the Management service.
```bash
docker compose restart management
```

4. Check logs to confirm the store switch:
```bash
docker compose logs management
```

You should see an entry similar to:
```
2024-05-10T15:09:34Z INFO management/server/store.go:109: using SQLite file store engine
```

## Optional Rollback Postgres data to Sqlite

This is optional and should be used only if you want to rollback the data from Postgres to SQLite while running the same NetBird version.
For migrating the Postgres data, we rely on the `pg_dump`, `sed`, and `sqlite3` tools. Make sure these are installed before proceeding

1. Export Postgres data
```bash
pg_dump --data-only --column-inserts "postgresql://<PG_USER>:<PG_PASSWORD>@<PG_HOST>:<PG_PORT>/<PG_DB_NAME>" > data.sql
```

2. Convert exported Postgres data sql to Sqlite format
```bash
sed \
-e 's/\\\\:/\:/g' \
-e 's/\\\\//g' \
-e 's/\\\\;/;/g' \
-e '/^SET /d' \
-e '/setval/d' \
-e "s/'true'/1/g" \
-e "s/'false'/0/g" \
-e 's/public\.//' \
-e '/^[[:space:]]*SELECT/d' data.sql > data.sql
```

3. Generate database schema from Sqlite backup
```bash
sqlite3 backup/store.db '.schema' > schema.sql
````

4. Create Sqlite database with Postgres exported data
```bash
sqlite3 store.db '.read schema.sql' && sqlite3 store.db '.read data.sql'
```

5. Copy db to the management container
```bash
docker compose cp store.db management:/var/lib/netbird/store.db
```

6. Enable SQLite by updating the `management.json` file and setting the `Engine` field to `sqlite` as the following example:
```json
"StoreConfig": {
    "Engine": "sqlite"
}
```

7. Restart the Management service.
```bash
docker compose restart management
```

8. Check logs to confirm the store switch:
```bash
docker compose logs management
```

You should see an entry similar to:
```
2024-05-10T15:09:34Z INFO management/server/store.go:109: using SQLite file store engine
```
