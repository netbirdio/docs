# Management Postgresql store

<Note>
This feature provides experimental support for using Postgres as the storage engine. Please use with caution and ensure proper testing in your environment.
</Note>

## Using Postgres for fresh installations

As of version 0.26.0, the default configuration for fresh installations is SQLite storage.
However, users have the option to leverage the benefits of Postgres for new instances beginning from version `<version>`.
To enable Postgres, add to your `setup.env` the following variable:
```bash
NETBIRD_STORE_CONFIG_ENGINE=postgres
```
This will result in a configuration similar to the following in your `management.json` file:
```json
    "StoreConfig": {
        "Engine": "postgres"
    }
```
You can switch back to sqlite storage by setting the `NETBIRD_STORE_CONFIG_ENGINE` variable to `sqlite`.
<Note>
    Switching between storage options requires migration steps to prevent data loss.
</Note>


## Migrating from SQLite store to Postgres store
This migration process allows users to seamlessly transition between storage options while maintaining data integrity.

<Note>
    The following commands assume you use the latest docker version with the compose plugin. If you have docker-compose installed as a standalone, please use docker-compose as a command.
</Note>

1. Backup your data store (`store.db` in `datadir` - default `/var/lib/netbird/`)
```bash
mkdir backup
docker compose cp -a management:/var/lib/netbird/. backup/
```

2. Import Sqlite data to Postgres

For migrating the Sqlite data we rely on the [pgloader](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader) tool. You can install it by running
`sudo apt-get install pgloader` on debian or `brew install pgloader` on MacOS.

```bash
pgloader --type sqlite backup/store.db "postgresql://<PG_USER>:<PG_PASSWORD>@<PG_HOST>:<PG_PORT>/<PG_DB_NAME>"
```

3. Enable Postgres by updating the `management.json` file and setting the `Engine` field to `postgres` as the following example:
```json
"StoreConfig": {
    "Engine": "postgres"
}
```

4. Create `.env` file with the following content:
```bash
NETBIRD_STORE_ENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN="host=<PG_HOST> user=<PG_USER> password=<PG_PASSWORD> dbname=<PG_DB_NAME> port=<PG_PORT>"
```

5. Update `docker-compose.yml` file to  pass the postgres configuration to the `management` container
```yaml
environment:
  - NETBIRD_STORE_ENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN=${NETBIRD_STORE_ENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN}
env_file:
  - .env
```

6. Restart the management service
```bash
docker compose restart management
```

7. Check logs to confirm the store switch:
```bash
docker compose logs management
```
You should see an entry similar to:
```
2024-05-10T15:09:34Z INFO management/server/store.go:109: using Postgres store engine
```

## Rollback to Sqlite store
To rollback to the Sqlite  store, follow these steps:
<Note>
    The following commands assume you use the latest docker version with the compose plugin. If you have docker-compose installed as a standalone, please use docker-compose as a command.
</Note>

1. Restore `store.db` backup
```bash
docker compose cp backup/. management:/var/lib/netbird/
```

2. Enable SQLite by updating the `management.json` file and setting the `Engine` field to `sqlite` as the following example:
```json
"StoreConfig": {
    "Engine": "sqlite"
}
```

3. Restart the Management service.
```bash
docker compose restart management
```

4. Check logs to confirm the store switch:
```bash
docker compose logs management
```

You should see an entry similar to:
```
2024-05-10T15:09:34Z INFO management/server/store.go:109: using SQLite file store engine
```

## Optional Rollback Postgres data to Sqlite

This is optional and should be used only if you want to rollback the data from Postgres to Sqlite while running the same NetBird version

1. Export Postgres data
```bash
pg_dump --data-only --inserts "postgresql://<PG_USER>:<PG_PASSWORD>@<PG_HOST>:<PG_PORT>/<PG_DB_NAME>" > data.sql
```

2. Convert exported Postgres data sql to Sqlite format
```bash
sed \
-e 's/\\\\:/\:/g' \
-e 's/\\\\//g' \
-e 's/\\\\;/;/g' \
-e '/^SET /d' \
-e '/setval/d' \
-e "s/'true'/1/g" \
-e "s/'false'/0/g" \
-e 's/public\.//' \
-e '/^[[:space:]]*SELECT/d' data.sql > data.sql
```

3. Copy data to the management container
```bash
docker compose cp data.sql management:/var/lib/netbird/data.sql
```

4. Restore exported data
```bash
docker compose exec management sh -c "apt-get install -y sqlite3 && sqlite3 /var/lib/netbird/store.db '.schema' > /var/lib/netbird/schema.sql"
docker compose exec management sh -c "rm /var/lib/netbird/store.db && sqlite3 /var/lib/netbird/store.db '.read /var/lib/netbird/schema.sql' && sqlite3 /var/lib/netbird/store.db '.read /var/lib/netbird/data.sql'"
````

5. Restart the Management service.
```bash
docker compose restart management
```
