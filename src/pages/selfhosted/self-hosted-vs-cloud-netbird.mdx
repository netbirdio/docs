# Self-hosted vs. Cloud-hosted NetBird

NetBird can be used in two ways: self-hosted and cloud-hosted (SaaS). The self-hosted version is a standalone version
that can be installed on your own servers while the cloud-hosted version is a SaaS (Software as a Service) that is hosted
on our servers.

Often times, the question arises: what is the difference between the two? This post gives a short overview of the
differences between the two versions.

## Installation and Maintenance

NetBird platform is a combination of [multiple components](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works) that make it possible for
machines to establish direct point-to-point connections and for network administrators to manage the network,
e.g., control network access.

When running the self-hosted version, you are responsible for installing and maintaining all the components as well as backing up
and securing the data.
The cloud-hosted NetBird only requires you to install the client software (NetBird agent) on your machines and log them in to the network.
The cloud-hosted version is more suitable for organizations that want a hassle-free solution that is easy to set up and maintain.

## Features

While the self-hosted and cloud-hosted versions share the same core connectivity features, the cloud-hosted version has
some additional features that are targeted at business customers and help with network automation and management. These features include:

- **[Event streaming](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/activity-event-streaming)** to 3rd party platforms and SIEM systems.
- **[Integrations with EDR](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/endpoint-detection-and-response)** like CrowdStrike and others.
- **[Users and groups provisioning](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/idp-sync)** from your identity provider (IdP).
- **[Peer approval](/how-to/approve-peers)** to join the network.
- **[User invites](/how-to/add-users-to-your-network#direct-user-invites)**.

## Geo Distributed Relay Servers

NetBird uses relay servers to establish connections between machines when a direct point-to-point connections isn't possible.

When using the cloud-hosted version, you benefit from the geo-distributed relay server clusters that are located in multiple regions
around the world ensuring that your machines can always establish a connection. The NetBird agents pick the closest relay server.

When using the self-hosted version, you need to set up your own relay servers. This a complex task and requires additional
maintenance effort.

## Highly Available Management Layer

When using the cloud-hosted version, you benefit from highly available control plane servers (Management) providing stability for
your critical network infrastructure.
