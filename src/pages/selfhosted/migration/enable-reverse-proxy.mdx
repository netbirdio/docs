# Migration Guide: Enable Reverse Proxy Feature

This guide walks you through adding the NetBird Reverse Proxy to an existing self-hosted deployment. By the end, you'll have a `netbird-proxy` container running alongside your existing services, ready to expose internal applications to the public internet.

<Note>
**Who is this guide for?** This migration guide is for existing self-hosted users who:
- Already have a working NetBird deployment (management server, dashboard, signal, relay)
- Want to enable the [Reverse Proxy](/manage/reverse-proxy) feature to expose internal services publicly
- Are running their services via Docker Compose
</Note>

## Why Traefik is required

The NetBird proxy container manages its own TLS certificates (via Let's Encrypt or static files). This means the reverse proxy sitting in front of it **must not terminate TLS** - it needs to pass raw TLS connections through to the proxy container untouched.

This capability is called **TLS passthrough**, and among common reverse proxies, **only Traefik supports it** via its TCP routers. Other reverse proxies (Nginx, Caddy, Nginx Proxy Manager) terminate TLS themselves and cannot forward the raw encrypted connection, which breaks the proxy's certificate management.

If your current deployment uses a reverse proxy other than Traefik, you'll need to switch before enabling this feature. See [Switching to Traefik](/selfhosted/reverse-proxy#traefik) for instructions.

## Overview of changes

### What you're adding

- **`netbird-proxy` container** - a new service in your Docker Compose stack that handles TLS termination, certificate provisioning, and traffic forwarding for reverse proxy services
- **Traefik TCP labels** - routing rules that tell Traefik to pass TLS connections through to the proxy container
- **Wildcard DNS record** - so that all service subdomains (e.g., `myapp.proxy.example.com`) resolve to your server
- **Proxy access token** - generated via the management CLI, used by the proxy to authenticate with the management server

### What stays the same

- Your existing `netbird-server`, `dashboard`, `signal`, and `relay` services are unchanged
- Your `management.json` and other configuration files require no modifications — **unless** you use an external identity provider (not the embedded IdP). See [Configure SSO for external identity providers](#configure-sso-for-external-identity-providers) below.
- Existing peers, networks, and access policies are unaffected

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Traefik** as your reverse proxy (see [Why Traefik is required](#why-traefik-is-required) above)
- **Latest `netbird-server` image** - pull the latest version to ensure the management CLI supports token creation
- **A domain for the proxy** - e.g., `proxy.example.com`. Service subdomains will be created under this domain (e.g., `myapp.proxy.example.com`)
- **Wildcard DNS capability** - ability to create a `*.proxy.example.com` DNS record pointing to your server

<Warning>
The proxy domain **must not** be a subdomain of your NetBird management domain. For example, if your management server is at `netbird.example.com`, do not use `proxy.netbird.example.com`. Use a separate subdomain like `proxy.example.com` instead. Using a subdomain of the management domain causes TLS and routing conflicts between the proxy and management services.
</Warning>
- **Port 443 accessible** - the proxy needs this for ACME TLS-ALPN-01 challenges (certificate provisioning)

## Migration steps

### Step 1: Backup current configuration

```bash
# Create a backup directory
mkdir -p netbird-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
cd netbird-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Backup configuration files
cp ../docker-compose.yml .
cp ../management.json .
cp ../*.env . 2>/dev/null || echo "No .env files found"
```

### Step 2: Generate a proxy access token

The proxy authenticates with the management server using an access token. Generate one using the management CLI:

```bash
docker exec -it netbird-server netbird-mgmt token create --name "my-proxy"
```

This outputs a token in the format `nbx_...` (40 characters). **Save the token immediately** - it is only displayed once. The management server stores only a SHA-256 hash.

You can manage tokens later with:

```bash
# List all tokens
docker exec -it netbird-server netbird-mgmt token list

# Revoke a token by ID
docker exec -it netbird-server netbird-mgmt token revoke <token-id>
```

### Step 3: Add the proxy service to docker-compose.yml

Add the following service to your `docker-compose.yml`. Replace the placeholder values with your actual token and domains:

```yaml
netbird-proxy:
  image: netbirdio/netbird-proxy:latest
  container_name: netbird-proxy
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks: [netbird]
  environment:
    - NB_PROXY_TOKEN=nbx_your_token_here
    - NB_PROXY_DOMAIN=proxy.example.com
    - NB_PROXY_MANAGEMENT_ADDRESS=https://netbird.example.com:443
    - NB_PROXY_ACME_CERTIFICATES=true
  labels:
    - traefik.enable=true
    - traefik.tcp.routers.netbird-proxy.rule=HostSNI(`*.proxy.example.com`)
    - traefik.tcp.routers.netbird-proxy.entrypoints=websecure
    - traefik.tcp.routers.netbird-proxy.tls.passthrough=true
    - traefik.tcp.routers.netbird-proxy.priority=1
    - traefik.tcp.services.netbird-proxy.loadbalancer.server.port=8443
  logging:
    driver: "json-file"
    options:
      max-size: "500m"
      max-file: "2"
```

The Traefik labels configure a **TCP router** that:
- Matches any request to `*.proxy.example.com` via SNI (Server Name Indication)
- Uses the `websecure` entrypoint (port 443)
- Passes the TLS connection through **without termination** (`tls.passthrough=true`)
- Uses `priority=1` to avoid intercepting traffic meant for the main NetBird HTTP routers on the same entrypoint
- Forwards traffic to the proxy container on port 8443

<Note>
Replace `proxy.example.com` in both the `NB_PROXY_DOMAIN` environment variable and the Traefik `HostSNI` rule with your actual proxy domain. These must match.
</Note>

### Step 4: Set up wildcard DNS

Create a wildcard DNS record pointing to the server running your NetBird stack:

```
*.proxy.example.com  →  <your-server-IP>
```

This ensures that all service subdomains (e.g., `myapp.proxy.example.com`, `dashboard.proxy.example.com`) resolve to your server where Traefik forwards them to the proxy container.

### Step 5: Apply changes

```bash
# Pull the new image
docker compose pull netbird-proxy

# Start the proxy alongside existing services
docker compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker compose ps

# Check proxy logs
docker compose logs -f netbird-proxy
```

You should see log messages indicating the proxy has connected to the management server and is ready to serve traffic.

### Step 6: Verify in the dashboard

Once the proxy connects to the management server:

1. Open your NetBird dashboard
2. Navigate to **Reverse Proxy** > **Services**
3. Click **Add Service**
4. In the domain selector, you should see your proxy domain (e.g., `proxy.example.com`) with a **Cluster** badge

If the domain appears, the proxy is connected and ready. You can now [create your first service](/manage/reverse-proxy#quick-start).

## Configure SSO for external identity providers

### Who this applies to

This section applies to deployments using a **standalone external identity provider** (Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Zitadel, etc.) instead of the built-in embedded IdP (Dex). If you deployed using the quickstart script with default settings, you are using the embedded IdP and can skip this section.

### Why this is needed

The reverse proxy SSO feature authenticates users through an OAuth2/OIDC flow that redirects through a callback endpoint on the management server (`/api/reverse-proxy/callback`). The embedded IdP registers this callback automatically, but external IdPs need it configured manually. Without this configuration, SSO authentication on reverse proxy services will silently fail.

### Option A: Quick fix (keep your external IdP)

If you want to keep using your current external identity provider, follow these three steps:

#### Step 1: Add callback URL to management.json

Add the `AuthCallbackURL` field to the `HttpConfig` section of your `management.json`:

```json
"HttpConfig": {
  ...existing fields...,
  "AuthCallbackURL": "https://<your-management-domain>/api/reverse-proxy/callback"
}
```

Replace `<your-management-domain>` with your NetBird management server domain (the same domain used for the dashboard).

#### Step 2: Register callback in your IdP

In your identity provider's application settings, add the following URL as an allowed redirect URI / callback URL:

```
https://<your-management-domain>/api/reverse-proxy/callback
```

This is in addition to any existing redirect URIs (like `/auth` or `/silent-auth`).

Where to find this setting in common providers:

| Provider | Where to add the redirect URI |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Auth0 | Application > Settings > Allowed Callback URLs |
| Okta | Application > General > Login redirect URIs |
| Keycloak | Client > Settings > Valid redirect URIs |
| Zitadel | Application > Redirect Settings > Redirect URIs |
| Generic OIDC | Refer to your provider's documentation |

#### Step 3: Restart management server

Restart the management service to pick up the configuration change:

```bash
docker compose restart netbird-management
```

### Option B: Migrate to the embedded IdP (recommended)

The embedded IdP (Dex) handles the reverse proxy callback registration automatically — no manual configuration needed. If you want a simpler setup, consider migrating to the embedded IdP.

With the embedded IdP, external identity providers can still be used as **connectors** alongside local authentication. This means your users can continue to sign in with their existing accounts (Google, Okta, Keycloak, etc.) while the embedded IdP manages the OIDC layer.

See the [Identity Providers page](/selfhosted/identity-providers) for instructions on adding external IdPs as connectors.

<Note>
Migrating from a standalone external IdP to the embedded IdP with your IdP as a connector requires user ID migration. See the [Migration Guide](/selfhosted/identity-providers#migration-guide-and-backwards-compatibility) or contact [support@netbird.io](mailto:support@netbird.io) for assistance.
</Note>

### Verification

After configuring SSO for your external identity provider, verify it works:

1. Create a reverse proxy service with **SSO authentication** enabled
2. Open the service URL in an incognito/private browser window
3. Confirm you are redirected to your IdP login page
4. After authenticating, confirm you are redirected back to the service and can access it

If the redirect fails or you see an error from your IdP, double-check that the callback URL is correctly registered in both `management.json` and your identity provider's settings.

## For users not on Traefik

If your self-hosted deployment currently uses Nginx, Caddy, or another reverse proxy, you'll need to switch to Traefik before enabling the Reverse Proxy feature. See the [Traefik setup instructions](/selfhosted/reverse-proxy#traefik) for a step-by-step guide on configuring Traefik for your NetBird deployment.

## Environment variable reference

| Variable | Required | Description | Default |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NB_PROXY_TOKEN` | Yes | Access token generated via `netbird-mgmt token create`. The proxy refuses to start without it. | - |
| `NB_PROXY_DOMAIN` | Yes | Base domain for this proxy instance (e.g., `proxy.example.com`). Determines the domain available for services. | - |
| `NB_PROXY_MANAGEMENT_ADDRESS` | No | URL of your NetBird management server. The proxy connects via gRPC to register itself. | `https://api.netbird.io:443` |
| `NB_PROXY_ADDRESS` | No | Address the proxy listens on. | `:8443` (Docker), `:443` (binary) |
| `NB_PROXY_ACME_CERTIFICATES` | No | Set to `true` to enable automatic TLS certificate provisioning via Let's Encrypt. | `false` |
| `NB_PROXY_ACME_CHALLENGE_TYPE` | No | ACME challenge type: `tls-alpn-01` (port 443) or `http-01` (port 80). | `tls-alpn-01` |
| `NB_PROXY_CERTIFICATE_FILE` | No | TLS certificate filename within the certificate directory (for static certificate mode). | `tls.crt` |
| `NB_PROXY_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE` | No | TLS private key filename within the certificate directory (for static certificate mode). | `tls.key` |
| `NB_PROXY_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY` | No | Directory where static certificate files are stored. | `./certs` |

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate provisioning failures

**Symptom**: Services stay in `certificate_pending` or move to `certificate_failed` status.

**Checklist**:
1. Verify port 443 is accessible from the internet (required for `tls-alpn-01` challenge)
2. Ensure the wildcard DNS record resolves correctly: `dig myapp.proxy.example.com`
3. Check proxy logs for ACME errors: `docker compose logs netbird-proxy | grep -i acme`
4. If using `http-01` challenge type, ensure port 80 is also accessible

### TLS passthrough not working

**Symptom**: The proxy starts but services return TLS errors or Traefik's default certificate.

**Checklist**:
1. Verify Traefik labels include `tls.passthrough=true`
2. Confirm the router is configured as a **TCP** router (not HTTP) - labels should use `traefik.tcp.routers`, not `traefik.http.routers`
3. Check that the `HostSNI` rule matches your proxy domain with the wildcard (`*.proxy.example.com`)
4. Verify the TCP router has `priority=1` to prevent it from intercepting traffic meant for the main NetBird HTTP routers
5. Ensure the `websecure` entrypoint is configured in your Traefik configuration
6. Restart Traefik after adding the proxy container: `docker compose restart traefik`

### Port conflicts

**Symptom**: The proxy container fails to start with an address-in-use error.

**Solution**: The proxy listens on port 8443 inside the container. If another service uses port 8443 on the same Docker network, change `NB_PROXY_ADDRESS` to a different port and update the Traefik label `loadbalancer.server.port` to match.

## Rollback procedure

If you need to remove the proxy and revert to your previous configuration:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Restore your backup
cd netbird-backup-YYYYMMDD
cp docker-compose.yml ../

# Restart without the proxy
cd ..
docker compose up -d
```

You can also revoke the proxy token to prevent the proxy from reconnecting:

```bash
docker exec -it netbird-server netbird-mgmt token list
docker exec -it netbird-server netbird-mgmt token revoke <token-id>
```
