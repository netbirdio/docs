## Upgrade Your Self-Hosted NetBird Installation

### Check for Updates

The NetBird Dashboard displays an update indicator at the bottom of the left navigation menu when a new version is available:

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/selfhosted/maintenance/update-available.png" alt="update-available" className="imagewrapper-small"/>
</p>

You can also check the current version programmatically via the API (requires authentication):

```bash
curl 'https://your-netbird-domain/api/instance/version' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>'
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "dashboard_available_version": "2.28.0",
    "management_available_version": "0.64.1",
    "management_current_version": "0.64.0",
    "management_update_available": true
}
```

### Check Release Notes

<Note>
