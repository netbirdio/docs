# Self-Hosting Quickstart Guide (5 min)

NetBird is open source and can be self-hosted on your servers. If you would like to learn more about the architecture please refer to the [Architecture section](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works).

<Note>
This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
</Note>

## Infrastructure requirements
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM must be publicly accessible on **TCP ports 80 and 443**, and **UDP port 3478**.
- A **public domain** name that resolves to the VM's public IP address (e.g. `netbird.example.com`).
- *(Optional, for Proxy feature)* A **separate domain** for the proxy with a **wildcard DNS record** pointing to the same server IP. For example, if your management domain is `netbird.example.com`, add a wildcard record for `*.proxy.netbird.example.com`.

## Software requirements

- Docker with docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or Docker with docker-compose version 2 or higher
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) - install with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) - install with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

## Installation Script

Download and run the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started.sh | bash
```

Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker compose`. The quick start script generates a full, production-ready NetBird installation. If you'd like to customize the install or gain a better understanding of the files
generated by the script, including the docker compose file, please refer to our [Configuration files](/selfhosted/configuration-files) guide.

### Reverse Proxy Selection

The script will prompt you to select a reverse proxy option:

```
Which reverse proxy will you use?
  [0] Traefik (recommended - automatic TLS, included in Docker Compose)
  [1] Existing Traefik (labels for external Traefik instance)
  [2] Nginx (generates config template)
  [3] Nginx Proxy Manager (generates config + instructions)
  [4] External Caddy (generates Caddyfile snippet)
  [5] Other/Manual (displays setup documentation)

Enter choice [0-5] (default: 0):
```

**For this quickstart guide, select option `[0]` (Traefik)** - just press Enter to use the default. This option includes a Traefik container in the Docker Compose that handles TLS certificates automatically via Let's Encrypt, requires no additional configuration, and makes it easy to enable the NetBird Proxy in the next step.

<Note>
If you already have a reverse proxy (Traefik, Nginx, etc.) and want to use it instead, the script will guide you through the setup. See the [Reverse Proxy Configuration](/selfhosted/reverse-proxy) guide for detailed instructions on each option.
</Note>


## Enable the NetBird Proxy Service

When you select the built-in Traefik option (`[0]`), the script asks whether you want to enable the NetBird Proxy service:

```
Do you want to enable the NetBird Proxy service?
The proxy allows you to selectively expose internal NetBird network resources
to the internet. You control which resources are exposed through the dashboard.
Enable proxy? [y/N]:
```

If you answer `y`, the script prompts for a **proxy domain**:

```
NOTE: The proxy domain must be different from the management domain (netbird.example.com)
to avoid TLS certificate conflicts.

You also need to add two CNAME records with one wildcard for the proxy domain,
e.g. proxy.example.com and *.proxy.example.com pointing to the same server IP as netbird.example.com.

Enter the domain for the NetBird Proxy (e.g. proxy.netbird.example.com):
```

<Warning>
The proxy domain **must be different** from your NetBird management domain to avoid TLS certificate conflicts.
</Warning>

The script then automatically generates a proxy access token, creates a `proxy.env` configuration file, and starts the proxy container alongside the other services. Point a wildcard DNS record (e.g. `*.proxy.netbird.example.com`) to your server's IP address so that service subdomains resolve correctly.

### CNAME Record for Proxy Domain

For certificates to work properly, ensure you have the proper records set with your domain name registrar. The first A record below should already be setup prior to starting the quick start script.

| Type | Name | Content | Proxy status (Cloudflare) |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| A | `netbird` | `YOUR.SERVER.IP.ADDRESS` | DNS only |
| CNAME | `proxy` | `netbird.example.com` | DNS only |
| CNAME | `*.proxy` | `netbird.example.com` | DNS only |

If you skipped the proxy during initial setup, you can add it later by following the [Enable Reverse Proxy migration guide](/selfhosted/migration/enable-reverse-proxy).

### Generated Files

The script generates the following files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Docker Compose configuration with all services |
| `config.yaml` | Combined server configuration (management, signal, relay, STUN) |
| `dashboard.env` | Environment variables for the dashboard container |
| `proxy.env` | Environment variables for the proxy container (only when proxy is enabled) |

For options 2-4, additional configuration files are generated (e.g., `nginx-netbird.conf`, `caddyfile-netbird.txt`, or `npm-advanced-config.txt`).

### Initial setup (Onboarding)

The script deploys NetBird **without any users**. Once complete, you'll need to create your first user:

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/selfhosted/quickstart/setup.png" alt="NetBird setup page" width="600"/>
</p>

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://netbird.example.com`
2. You'll be redirected to the setup page (`/setup`)
3. Create your admin account:
   - Enter your email address
   - Enter your name
   - Enter a password
   - Click **Create Account**

You can then log in with your email and password.

<Note>
The `/setup` page is only accessible when no users exist. After creating the first user, it redirects to the regular login page.
</Note>

## Add More Users
NetBird includes built-in local user management powered by an embedded <a href="https://dexidp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dex</a> server, allowing you to create and manage users directly from the Dashboard without requiring an external identity provider. You can also add external identity providers for SSO authentication alongside local users.
<Tiles
  id="user-management"
  items={[
    {
      href: '/selfhosted/identity-providers/local',
      name: 'Local User Management',
      description: 'Create and manage users directly from the NetBird Dashboard. No external identity provider required.',
    },
    {
      href: '/selfhosted/identity-providers',
      name: 'Identity Providers',
      description: 'Connect external identity providers like Google, Microsoft, Okta, or self-hosted IdPs for SSO authentication.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Maintenance

Once your NetBird instance is running, refer to these guides for ongoing maintenance:

<Tiles
  id="maintenance"
  items={[
    {
      href: '/selfhosted/maintenance/backup',
      name: 'Backup',
      description: 'Back up your NetBird configuration and data to protect against data loss.',
    },
    {
      href: '/selfhosted/maintenance/upgrade',
      name: 'Upgrade',
      description: 'Upgrade your NetBird installation to the latest version.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<Tiles
    id="scaling"
    items={[
        {
            href: '/selfhosted/maintenance/scaling/scaling-your-self-hosted-deployment',
            name: 'Scaling Your Self-Hosted Deployment',
            description: 'Split your NetBird deployment into multiple nodes to scale your deployment.',
        },
        {
            href: '/selfhosted/configuration-files',
            name: 'Configuration Files Reference',
            description: 'Learn more about the configuration files generated by the quick start script and how to customize them.',
        },
    ]}
/>

## Troubleshoot

- **I can't access the `/setup` page**

  The setup page is only available when no users exist. If you've already created a user, go to the main login page instead.

- **I forgot my admin password**

  You can create a new user via the API using a PAT (Personal Access Token) from an existing admin, or reset the database to start fresh.

- **SSO provider not appearing on login page**

  Check that the connector is properly configured in **Settings** → **Identity Providers**. Ensure the redirect URL is correctly configured in your IdP.

For more troubleshooting help, see the [Troubleshooting guide](/selfhosted/troubleshooting).
