# Self-Hosting Quickstart Guide (5 min)

NetBird is open source and can be self-hosted on your servers. If you would like to learn more about the architecture please refer to the [Architecture section](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works).

<Note>
This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM. Please ensure your infrastructure meets our [minimum requirements](#requirements) before proceeding.
</Note>

## Installation Script

Download and run the installation script, replacing `netbird.example.com` after `NETBIRD_DOMAIN` in the command below:

```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started.sh | bash
```

Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`.

If you want to check the script before running it, you can download it and run it locally:
```bash
curl -sSLO https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started.sh
# check the script
cat getting-started.sh
# run the script
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com
bash getting-started.sh
```
<Note>
Replace `netbird.example.com` with your domain name.
</Note>

An example output of the script:

```bash
root@selfhosted-1:~/netbird# bash getting-started.sh

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following infrastructure and software in place:

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Linux VM with at least **1 CPU** and **2GB** of memory |
| | Publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443**, and UDP port **3478** |
| | **Public domain name** pointing to the VM |
| **Software** | Docker with docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or Docker with docker-compose version 2 or higher |
| | [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — install with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq` |
| | [curl](https://curl.se/) — install with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl` |

### Initial setup (Onboarding)

The script deploys NetBird **without any users**. Once complete, you'll need to create your first user:

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/selfhosted/quickstart/setup.png" alt="NetBird setup page" width="600"/>
</p>

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://netbird.example.com`
2. You'll be redirected to the setup page (`/setup`)
3. Create your admin account:
   - Enter your email address
   - Enter your name
   - Enter a password
   - Click **Create Account**

You can then log in with your email and password.

<Note>
The `/setup` page is only accessible when no users exist. After creating the first user, it redirects to the regular login page.
</Note>

## Add More Users
NetBird includes built-in local user management powered by an embedded <a href="https://dexidp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dex</a> server, allowing you to create and manage users directly from the Dashboard without requiring an external identity provider. You can also add external identity providers for SSO authentication alongside local users.
<Tiles 
  id="user-management"
  items={[
    {
      href: '/selfhosted/identity-providers/local',
      name: 'Local User Management',
      description: 'Create and manage users directly from the NetBird Dashboard. No external identity provider required.',
    },
    {
      href: '/selfhosted/identity-providers',
      name: 'Identity Providers',
      description: 'Connect external identity providers like Google, Microsoft, Okta, or self-hosted IdPs for SSO authentication.',
    },
  ]} 
/>

## Manage Installation

### Backup

To back up your NetBird installation, you need to copy the configuration files and the Management service databases.

The configuration files are located in the folder where you ran the installation script. To back up, copy the files to a backup location:
```bash
mkdir backup
cp docker-compose.yml Caddyfile dashboard.env turnserver.conf management.json relay.env backup/
```
To save the Management service databases, stop the Management service and copy the files from the store directory:
```bash
docker compose stop management
docker compose cp -a management:/var/lib/netbird/ backup/
docker compose start management
```

### Upgrade

To upgrade NetBird to the latest version:

1. Run the backup steps described in the [backup](#backup) section.
2. Review the [release notes](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases) for any breaking changes.
3. Pull the latest NetBird docker images:
    ```bash
    docker compose pull management dashboard signal relay
    ```
4. Restart the NetBird containers with the new images:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --force-recreate management dashboard signal relay
    ```

<Note>
For upgrades from older versions (pre-v0.26.0), see the [Legacy upgrade notes](#legacy-self-hosting-with-zitadel-idp).
</Note>

### Remove
To remove the NetBird installation and all related data from your server, run these commands from the folder where you installed NetBird:
```bash
# remove all NetBird-related containers and volumes (data)
docker compose down --volumes
# remove downloaded and generated config files
rm -f docker-compose.yml Caddyfile dashboard.env turnserver.conf management.json relay.env
```

## Troubleshoot

- **I can't access the `/setup` page**
  
  The setup page is only available when no users exist. If you've already created a user, go to the main login page instead.

- **I forgot my admin password**
  
  You can create a new user via the API using a PAT (Personal Access Token) from an existing admin, or reset the database to start fresh.

- **SSO provider not appearing on login page**
  
  Check that the connector is properly configured in **Settings** → **Identity Providers**. Ensure the redirect URL is correctly configured in your IdP.

For more troubleshooting help, see the [Troubleshooting guide](/selfhosted/troubleshooting).
