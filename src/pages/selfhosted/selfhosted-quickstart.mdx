# Self-hosting quickstart guide (5 min)

NetBird is open-source and can be self-hosted on your servers.

It relies on components developed by NetBird Authors [Management Service](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/tree/main/management), [Management UI Dashboard](https://github.com/netbirdio/dashboard), [Signal Service](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/tree/main/signal),
a 3rd party open-source STUN/TURN service [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn), and an identity provider (available options will be listed later in this guide).

If you would like to learn more about the architecture please refer to the [Architecture section](/about-netbird/how-netbird-works).

<Note>
    It might be a good idea to try NetBird before self-hosting on your servers.
    We run NetBird in the cloud, and it will take a few clicks to get started with our managed version. [Check it out!](https://netbird.io/pricing)
</Note>

## Quick self-hosting with Zitadel IdP
In this guide, we will guide you through deploying NetBird with [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/)
as the identity provider for user management using a single-line setup script and docker containers.

<Note>
    This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
    Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-self-hosting-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.
</Note>

### Requirements

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

### Download and run the script

Download and run the installation script in a single line:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
If you want to check the script before running it, you can download it and run it locally:
```bash
curl -sSLO https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh
# check the script
cat getting-started-with-zitadel.sh
# run the script
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com
bash getting-started-with-zitadel.sh
```
<Note>
    Replace `netbird.example.com` with your domain name.
</Note>
Once the script execution is complete, you can access your netbird instance via the URL `https://netbird.example.com` using the credentials displayed in your terminal.

### Creating users
If you want to add additional users, you can access Zitadel's management console via the URL `https://netbird.example.com/ui/console` with the same credentials. Follow the [Users guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/console/users)
from Zitadel to add additional local users or integrate Zitadel with your existing identity provider by following the guide [Configure identity providers](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers).
