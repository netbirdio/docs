# Activity Events MySQL store

## Using MySQL for fresh installations

To enable MySQL add to your management service the following environmental variable:
```bash
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE=mysql
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_MYSQL_DSN="mysql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>"
```

You can switch back to sqlite storage by setting the `NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE` variable to `sqlite`.
<Note>
    Switching between storage options requires migration steps to prevent data loss.
