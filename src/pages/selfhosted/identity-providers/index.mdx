# Supported Identity Providers (IdPs)

NetBird’s self-hosted implementation (Community Edition) uses the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol for authentication, an
industry-standard identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. OIDC is used both for user authentication to access the
Management Service Dashboard and for user device authorization when accessing internal resources.

There are several Identity Provider (IdP) options available for running a self-hosted version of NetBird. This document provides
an overview of each option along with links to detailed setup guides.

<Note>
    In addition to OIDC-based authentication, NetBird supports provisioning users and groups through SCIM and the API.
    However, this functionality is not available in the open source Community Edition. It is offered only in the cloud-managed
    version of NetBird or through a [Commercial License](https://netbird.io/pricing#on-prem) for enterprise self-hosted deployments.
</Note>

## Our Approach

When a user attempts to access the NetBird network, the Management Service redirects them to your configured Identity Provider for authentication. After successful authentication, the IdP issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains the user's identity and claims. NetBird's Management Service validates this token and uses it to authenticate the user without ever storing passwords or sensitive credentials.

This approach provides several key benefits: it leverages your existing identity infrastructure, enables Single Sign-On (SSO) across your organization, maintains security through token-based authentication, and allows NetBird to cache user information like names and email addresses without storing sensitive data. 

## Self-hosted IdPs

Self-hosted Identity Providers give you full control over authentication and authorization of your NetBird network. You manage and maintain the IdP infrastructure yourself.
