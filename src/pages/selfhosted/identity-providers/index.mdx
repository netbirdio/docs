# Supported Identity Providers (IdPs)

NetBird's self-hosted implementation uses the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol for authentication, an industry-standard identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. OIDC is used both for user authentication to access the Management Service Dashboard and for user device authorization when accessing internal resources.

## Embedded IdP (Recommended)

Starting with version X.XX, NetBird includes a **built-in identity provider** powered by [Dex](https://dexidp.io/). This is now the default for new deployments and eliminates the need for separate IdP infrastructure.

With the embedded IdP, you can:

- **Create local users** directly from the NetBird Dashboard
- **Add SSO connectors** (Google, Microsoft, Okta, etc.) through the Dashboard UI
- **Simplify your deployment** with fewer containers and reduced resource requirements
- **Get started faster** with automatic configuration and no additional setup

<Note>
The embedded IdP uses [Dex](https://dexidp.io/), a lightweight, portable OIDC identity provider that supports federated authentication. Dex runs embedded within the NetBird Management service, requiring no additional containers or databases.

## How Authentication Works

When a user attempts to access the NetBird network, the Management Service handles authentication through the configured identity provider. After successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued containing the user's identity and claims. NetBird's Management Service validates this token and uses it to authenticate the user without ever storing passwords or sensitive credentials.

This approach provides several key benefits:

- **Simplified setup** with the embedded IdP—no separate infrastructure required
- **Flexibility to integrate** with your existing identity infrastructure
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across your organization through connectors
- **Security through token-based authentication**
- **Privacy-conscious caching** of user information without storing sensitive data

## Choosing Your Authentication Approach

| Approach | Best For | Setup Complexity |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Embedded IdP Only** | Homelabs, small teams, quick deployments | Minimal |
| **Embedded IdP + Connectors** | Organizations wanting SSO with existing providers | Low |
| **Standalone IdP (Advanced)** | Enterprises with existing IdP investments, SCIM requirements | Moderate to High |

### Embedded IdP Only

The simplest approach—create and manage users directly in NetBird:

- Local username/password authentication
- No additional services required
- User management through the Dashboard
- Ideal for homelabs, small teams, and proof-of-concept deployments

### Embedded IdP with Connectors

Combine the simplicity of embedded IdP with your existing identity providers:

- Keep local user management as a fallback
- Add Google, Microsoft, Okta, or other SSO for convenience
- Configure connectors directly from the Dashboard UI
- Best of both worlds

[About Connectors →](/selfhosted/identity-providers/connectors)

### Standalone IdP (Advanced)

For organizations with specific requirements or existing IdP investments:

- Full control over identity infrastructure
- Required for SCIM provisioning (Enterprise)
- Complex user lifecycle management needs
- Separate IdP container deployment

## Identity Provider Options

Each provider page includes both **connector setup** (recommended, for use with embedded IdP) and **standalone setup** (advanced) instructions.

### Self-Hosted Providers

Self-hosted Identity Providers give you full control over authentication and authorization.

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Zitadel**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/zitadel) | Open-source identity platform with multi-tenancy, passwordless auth, and OIDC/SAML support |
| [**Keycloak**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/keycloak) | Popular open-source IAM with extensive documentation and community support |
| [**Authentik**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/authentik) | Flexible open-source IdP with SSO, MFA, and policy management |
| [**PocketID**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/pocketid) | Lightweight, easy-to-deploy identity solution for self-hosted environments |

### Cloud/Managed Providers

Managed Identity Providers handle infrastructure and maintenance for you.

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Google**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/google) | Google accounts and Google Workspace authentication |
| [**Microsoft**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/microsoft) | Microsoft personal accounts and Entra ID (Azure AD) for work accounts |
| [**Okta**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/okta) | Enterprise identity and access management with extensive integrations |
| [**Auth0**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/auth0) | Flexible authentication service with customization options |
| [**JumpCloud**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/jumpcloud) | Cloud directory platform with identity and device management |

## User Provisioning

In addition to OIDC-based authentication, NetBird supports provisioning users and groups through SCIM and the API. However, this functionality is not available in the open source Community Edition. It is offered only in the cloud-managed version of NetBird or through a [Commercial License](https://netbird.io/pricing#on-prem) for enterprise self-hosted deployments.

## Migration Guide

If you have an existing NetBird deployment using a standalone IdP (like Zitadel from the previous quickstart), you can continue using it. To migrate to the embedded IdP:

1. Export your user list from your current IdP
2. Deploy the new version with embedded IdP enabled
3. Recreate users through the Dashboard or API
4. (Optional) Add your previous IdP as a connector for SSO

<Note>
User data and network configurations are preserved during migration. Only authentication changes—users may need to re-authenticate after the switch.
