# Supported Identity Providers (IdPs)

NetBird's self-hosted implementation uses the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol for authentication, an industry-standard identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. OIDC is used both for user authentication to access the Management Service Dashboard and for user device authorization when accessing internal resources.

## Local User Management

Starting with version X.XX, NetBird **no longer requires an external identity provider**. The Management service now supports creating and managing local users directly, so you can get started without setting up Zitadel, Keycloak, or any other IdP.

With local user management, you can:

- **Create local users** directly from the NetBird Dashboard
- **Add external identity providers** (Google, Microsoft, Okta, etc.) through the Dashboard UI
- **Configure multiple IdPs** simultaneously—users see all providers as login options
- **Simplify your deployment** with fewer containers and reduced resource requirements
- **Get started faster** with no additional IdP setup required

<Note>
Local user management is powered by an embedded [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) server running within the NetBird Management service, requiring no additional containers or databases.

## How Authentication Works

When a user attempts to access the NetBird network, the Management Service handles authentication through the configured identity provider. After successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued containing the user's identity and claims. NetBird's Management Service validates this token and uses it to authenticate the user without ever storing passwords or sensitive credentials.

This approach provides several key benefits:

- **Simplified setup** with the embedded IdP—no separate infrastructure required
- **Flexibility to integrate** with your existing identity infrastructure
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across your organization through connectors
- **Security through token-based authentication**
- **Privacy-conscious caching** of user information without storing sensitive data

## Choosing Your Authentication Approach

| Approach | Best For | Setup Complexity |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Local Users Only** | Homelabs, small teams, quick deployments | Minimal |
| **Local Users + External IdPs** | Organizations wanting SSO with existing providers | Low |
| **Standalone IdP (Advanced)** | Enterprises with existing IdP investments, SCIM requirements | Moderate to High |

### Local Users Only

The simplest approach—create and manage users directly in NetBird:

- Local username/password authentication
- No additional services required
- User management through the Dashboard
- Ideal for homelabs, small teams, and proof-of-concept deployments

### Local Users + External Identity Providers

Combine local user management with your existing identity providers:

- Keep local user management as a fallback
- Add Google, Microsoft, Okta, or other providers for SSO
- **Configure multiple IdPs**—users see all options on the login page
- Configure everything directly from the Dashboard UI
- Best of both worlds

### Standalone IdP (Advanced)

For organizations with specific requirements or existing IdP investments:

- Full control over identity infrastructure
- Required for SCIM provisioning (Enterprise)
- Complex user lifecycle management needs
- Separate IdP container deployment

## Identity Provider Options

Each provider page includes both **connector setup** (recommended, for adding to local user management) and **standalone setup** (advanced) instructions.

### Self-Hosted Providers

Self-hosted Identity Providers give you full control over authentication and authorization.

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Zitadel**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/zitadel) | Open-source identity platform with multi-tenancy, passwordless auth, and OIDC/SAML support |
| [**Keycloak**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/keycloak) | Popular open-source IAM with extensive documentation and community support |
| [**Authentik**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/authentik) | Flexible open-source IdP with SSO, MFA, and policy management |
| [**PocketID**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/pocketid) | Lightweight, easy-to-deploy identity solution for self-hosted environments |

### Cloud/Managed Providers

Managed Identity Providers handle infrastructure and maintenance for you.

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Google**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/google) | Google accounts and Google Workspace authentication |
| [**Microsoft**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/microsoft) | Microsoft personal accounts and Entra ID (Azure AD) for work accounts |
| [**Okta**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/okta) | Enterprise identity and access management with extensive integrations |
| [**Auth0**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/auth0) | Flexible authentication service with customization options |
| [**JumpCloud**](/selfhosted/identity-providers/jumpcloud) | Cloud directory platform with identity and device management |

## User Provisioning

In addition to OIDC-based authentication, NetBird supports provisioning users and groups through SCIM and the API. However, this functionality is not available in the open source Community Edition. It is offered only in the cloud-managed version of NetBird or through a [Commercial License](https://netbird.io/pricing#on-prem) for enterprise self-hosted deployments.

## Migration Guide

If you have an existing NetBird deployment using a standalone IdP (like Zitadel from the previous quickstart), you have several options:

1. **Keep using your standalone IdP** - No changes required, your setup continues to work
2. **Add your IdP as an external provider** - Keep your IdP but add it as an OIDC provider alongside local users
3. **Migrate to local users** - Export users from your IdP and recreate them as local users

<Note>
User data and network configurations are preserved during migration. Only authentication changes—users may need to re-authenticate after the switch.
