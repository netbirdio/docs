# Microsoft and Entra ID SSO with NetBird Self-Hosted

Use Microsoft accounts for authentication with NetBird. This supports both personal Microsoft accounts and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for work and school accounts.

## Management Setup (Recommended)

Add Microsoft as an external IdP directly in the NetBird Management Dashboard. Choose the appropriate identity provider type based on your needs:

| Identity Provider Type | Use Case |
|------------------------|----------|
| **Microsoft** (`microsoft`) | Personal Microsoft accounts |
| **Microsoft Entra ID** (`entra`) | Work/school accounts via Azure AD |

### Prerequisites

- NetBird self-hosted with embedded IdP enabled
- Access the [Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com/)

### Step 1: Start Creating App Registration

1. Navigate to [Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com/))
2. Click **App registrations** → **New registration**

</p>

3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `NetBird`
   - **Supported account types**: Choose based on your needs:
     - *Single tenant (your organization only)*: `Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default Directory only - Single tenant)`
     - *Multi-tenant (any Entra ID organization)*: `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant)`
     - *Multi-tenant with personal accounts*: `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`
     - *Personal accounts only*: `Personal Microsoft accounts only`
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave empty for now (you'll add this in Step 4)

4. **Don't click Register yet** — keep this tab open and proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Get Redirect URL from NetBird

1. Open a new tab or window and log in to your NetBird Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Identity Providers**
3. Click **Add Identity Provider**
4. Fill in the fields:

**For Personal Microsoft Accounts:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Microsoft |
| Name | Microsoft (or your preferred display name) |
| Client ID | From Azure app registration (will fill after Step 3) |
| Client Secret | From Azure app registration (will fill after Step 5) |

**For Microsoft Entra ID (Work/School):**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Microsoft Entra ID |
| Name | Microsoft Work (or your preferred display name) |
| Issuer URL | From Azure app registration (will fill after Step 3) |
| Client ID | From Azure app registration (will fill after Step 3) |
| Client Secret | From Azure app registration (will fill after Step 5) |

<Note>
**Issuer URL format:** `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0` where `{tenant-id}` is your Directory (tenant) ID from Azure.
</Note>

5. **Copy the Redirect URL** that NetBird displays (but don't click **Add Provider** yet)

</p>

### Step 3: Complete App Registration

1. Return to the Entra Admin Center tab
2. Click **Register**
3. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** — you'll need these for Step 6
4. Construct the **Issuer URL** using the format: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0` (replace `{tenant-id}` with your Directory (tenant) ID)

### Step 4: Configure Redirect URI

1. Still in the Entra Admin Center tab, go to **Authentication**
2. Click **Add a platform** → **Web**
3. In the dropdown next to the redirect URI field, select **Web**
4. Paste the redirect URL you copied from NetBird in the **Redirect URI** field

</p>

5. Click **Configure**

### Step 5: Create Client Secret

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets**
2. Click **New client secret**

    <img src="/docs-static/img/selfhosted/identity-providers/managed/microsoft-entra-id/4_new-client-secret-microsoft-entra.png" alt="New client secret" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

3. Add a description and expiration
4. Click **Add**
5. Copy the **Value** immediately (it won't be shown again) — you'll need this for Step 6

</p>

### Step 6: Complete NetBird Setup

1. Return to the NetBird tab
2. Fill in the fields:
   - **Client ID**: Paste the **Application (client) ID** from Step 3
   - **Client Secret**: Paste the **Value** from Step 5
   - **Issuer URL**: Paste the **Issuer URL** you constructed in Step 3 (for Entra ID only)

    <img src="/docs-static/img/selfhosted/identity-providers/managed/microsoft-entra-id/6_netbird-config-filled-microsoft-entra.png" alt="NetBird config filled" className="imagewrapper-big"/>
</p>

3. Click **Add Provider**

### Step 7: Test the Connection

1. Log out of NetBird Dashboard
2. On the login page, you should see the Microsoft button
3. Click it and sign in with your Microsoft account
4. You should be redirected back to NetBird and logged in. Unless your user approval setting were changed you will need to log back into your local admin account to approve the user.

## Standalone Setup (Advanced)

Use Microsoft Entra ID as your primary identity provider instead of NetBird's embedded IdP. This option gives you full control over authentication and user management, is recommended for experienced Microsoft Entra ID administrators as it also requires additional setup and ongoing maintenance.

For most deployments, the [embedded IdP](/selfhosted/identity-providers/local) is the simpler choice — it's built into NetBird, fully integrated, and requires minimal configuration to get started. For this implementation, go back up to the [Management Setup (Recommended)](#management-setup-recommended) section above.

For detailed instructions on the standalone setup, see the [Microsoft and Entra ID SSO with NetBird Self-Hosted (Legacy)](/selfhosted/identity-providers/managed/advanced/microsoft-entra-id) documentation.

<Note>
If you prefer to have full control over authentication, consider self-hosted alternatives like [PocketID](/selfhosted/identity-providers/pocketid).
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### "AADSTS50011: The redirect URI specified in the request does not match"

- Ensure the redirect URI in Azure exactly matches what NetBird provides
- Check platform type (SPA vs Mobile/Desktop)
- Verify no trailing slashes

### "AADSTS700016: Application not found"

- Verify the Application (client) ID is correct
- Check tenant ID for single-tenant apps
- Ensure the app registration is in the correct directory

### Users from wrong tenant signing in

- Use single-tenant configuration for organization-only access
- Verify "Supported account types" setting in app registration
