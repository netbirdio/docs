# Zitadel

[Zitadel](https://zitadel.com) is an open-source identity infrastructure platform designed for cloud-native environments. It provides multi-tenancy, customizable branding, passwordless authentication, and supports protocols like OpenID Connect, OAuth2, SAML2, and LDAP.

<Note>
Zitadel was previously used in the NetBird quickstart script. If you have an existing Zitadel deployment, you can continue using it as a standalone IdP or migrate to the embedded IdP with Zitadel as an external IdP directly in the NetBird Management Dashboard.
</Note>

## Management Setup (Recommended)

Add Zitadel as an external IdP directly in the NetBird Management Dashboard. This is the simplest approach for new deployments or when migrating from the previous quickstart.

### Prerequisites

- NetBird self-hosted with embedded IdP enabled
- Zitadel instance (cloud or self-hosted)

### Step 1: Create Application in Zitadel

1. Log in to your Zitadel Console
2. Navigate to your project (or create one)
3. Click **New** in the **Applications** section
4. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `NetBird`
   - **Type**: `Web`
5. Click **Continue**
6. Configure authentication:
   - **Authentication Method**: `Code` (not PKCE)
7. Leave redirect URIs empty for now
8. Click **Create**
9. Go to **Token Settings** and enable **User Info inside ID Token**
10. Note the **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**

### Step 2: Add Identity Provider in NetBird

1. Log in to your NetBird Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Identity Providers**
3. Click **Add Identity Provider**
4. Fill in the fields:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Zitadel |
| Name | Zitadel (or your preferred display name) |
| Client ID | From Zitadel application |
| Client Secret | From Zitadel application |
| Issuer | Your Zitadel URL (e.g., `https://your-instance.zitadel.cloud`) |

5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Configure Redirect URI

After saving, NetBird displays the **Redirect URL**. Copy this URL and add it to your Zitadel application:

1. Return to Zitadel Console
2. Go to your application → **Redirect Settings**
3. Add the redirect URL from NetBird to **Redirect URIs**
4. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. Log out of NetBird Dashboard
2. On the login page, you should see a "Zitadel" button
3. Click it and authenticate with your Zitadel credentials
4. You should be redirected back to NetBird and logged in

## Standalone Setup (Advanced)

Use Zitadel as your primary identity provider instead of NetBird's embedded IdP. This option gives you full control over authentication and user management, is recommended for experienced Zitadel administrators as it also requires additional setup and ongoing maintenance.

For most deployments, the [embedded IdP](/selfhosted/identity-providers/local) is the simpler choice — it's built into NetBird, fully integrated, and requires minimal configuration to get started. For this implementation, go back up to the [Management Setup (Recommended)](#management-setup-recommended) section above.

For detailed instructions on the standalone setup, see the [Zitadel SSO with NetBird Self-Hosted (Advanced)](/selfhosted/identity-providers/advanced/zitadel) documentation.

<Note>
If you prefer not to self-host, Zitadel offers a managed cloud option at [zitadel.com](https://zitadel.com/).

## Migrating from Zitadel Quickstart

If you deployed NetBird using the previous quickstart script with Zitadel:

**Option A - Keep using Zitadel standalone**: Continue with your existing setup. No changes needed.

**Option B - Add Zitadel as external IdP directly in NetBird Management Dashboard**:
1. Deploy new NetBird version with embedded IdP
2. Add your existing Zitadel as an external IdP directly in the NetBird Management Dashboard (follow Management Setup above)
3. Users can continue logging in with Zitadel
4. Optionally create local user accounts as fallback

**Option C - Migrate fully to embedded IdP**:
1. Export user list from Zitadel
2. Deploy new NetBird version with embedded IdP
3. Recreate users in NetBird Dashboard
4. Decommission Zitadel when ready

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid redirect URI" error

- Verify the redirect URI exactly matches what's configured
- Check for trailing slashes
- Ensure the application type is correct (User Agent for Dashboard)
